 colombe 2d*: hi all
 colombe 2d*: hi jansteen
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi colombe and malf
 jansteen 3d*:  You two are becoming my most reliable guests
 jansteen 3d*:  jl = jean-loupe?
 colombe 2d*: :)
 colombe 2d*: no jean loup
 colombe 2d*: the inventor of gzip
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi club
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi Jean
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi Jean-loup, je m'excuse :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Kobayashi Koichi (9p,B) vs Hane Yasumasa (9p,W)
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, time for a question: e3 or p17?
 colombe 2d*: all moves here possible, except on the 1rst or 2nd line
 colombe 2d*: no p17
 jansteen 3d*:  Answer is: both are possible and both have been played in professional Go
 ChickenJoe 4d :  Hi all
 jansteen 3d*:  p17 is discussed in Rin Kaiho's fuseki dictionary, e3 is this game
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi Joe
 jansteen 3d*:  Excuse me, just the other way around :)
]
;B[oc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, next white's move is common sense, e3 or e4, any preference?
 colombe 2d*: he he, see malf ...
 ChickenJoe 4d :  e4
 jansteen 3d*:  I think so, matter of taste

;B[dn]
;W[el]C[
 malf NR : ok, why did w not offer the taisha? matter of taste?
 jansteen 3d*:  taisha is unusual with h4 there, taisha possible with h4 at j3
 jansteen 3d*:  e8 is interesting
]
;B[en]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  right, e6 important, creating a dent in white's wall
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, club, you're in good shape tonight
]
;W[go]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  No, I didn't mean that :)
 jansteen 3d*:  But, let me fetch a beer....
 jansteen 3d*:  No malf, Heineken of course :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Suggestions for black's next move?
 malf NR : f6
 jansteen 3d*:  f6, then g4
 colombe 2d*: g4 is interesting also
 jansteen 3d*:  f7 is shape locally
 WatchOnly NR : f4
 malf NR : f7 lets w choose side
 jansteen 3d*:  f4 then g4
 colombe 2d*: g4
 jansteen 3d*:  g4 then f4 :)
 colombe 2d*: g4
 jansteen 3d*:  No, not f4 but f5 probably
 jansteen 3d*:  f7 shape locally
 malf NR : l3?
 jansteen 3d*:  But there is another big move
 colombe 2d*: d3 ???
 WatchOnly NR : q10
]
;B[dq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  d3 is huge
 jansteen 3d*:  With a base in the corner black has hands free to fight both sides
 jansteen 3d*:  Pros play so logically, irritating :)
 jansteen 3d*:  What's the price which black pays?
 colombe 2d*: d4 no good now
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, me too, very slow
 colombe 2d*: because overconcentrated shape after e2
 jansteen 3d*:  d4 helps black, agree
 colombe 2d*: h5
 colombe 2d*: i would play h5
 jansteen 3d*:  ok, multiple choice: h5, g4, or f6?
 malf NR : now g4?
 WatchOnly NR : f6
 colombe 2d*: i vote h5
 colombe 2d*: and i bet one 1d*
 colombe 2d*: if i lost, become 1d*
]
;W[fn]C[
 colombe 2d*: if i win, become 3d*
 jansteen 3d*:  there you go colombe... :)

 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 colombe 2d*: club remember zinc vs ingys game ? :)
 WatchOnly NR : f8
 colombe 2d*: yes :)
 colombe 2d*: the one who we understand nothing
]
;W[ho]C[
 colombe 2d*: i win !
 colombe 2d*: h5 is played
 jansteen 3d*:  WatchOnly, never give atari to cutting stone unless yuo can catch it
 rossignol NR : colombe 3d* !! but too late!
 jansteen 3d*:  Better aim geta like g8 in this position
 jansteen 3d*:  Bottom is important now, otherwise it turns into white territory
 jansteen 3d*:  So black starts sequence to settle here...
]
;B[nq]
;W[qn]
;B[jp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Nice sequence
 colombe 2d*: yes nice
 jansteen 3d*:  Black payed price though, r6 neutralizes right side shimari influence
 jansteen 3d*:  We will all end up low kyu if we have to pay grades for our mistakes :)
 jansteen 3d*:  White to play, where?
 colombe 2d*: let's think
 jansteen 3d*:  Typical pro move, WatchOnly knows
 jansteen 3d*:  WatchOnly is observer
 colombe 2d*: g8 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Good :)
 colombe 2d*: i said this first :)
]
;W[gl]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Capturing cutting stone is always big, and thick, pros like that
 jansteen 3d*:  Amateurs tend to play thin
 jansteen 3d*:  Black to play, big point, where?
 jansteen 3d*:  q10 is not so valuable enrico, since it doesn't affect white's bottom-right
 malf NR : q4
 jansteen 3d*:  k16 is correct direction
 jansteen 3d*:  malf, no need to strengthen white here, black's bottom group is ok for the moment
]
;B[fc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black decides to go all the way (instead of k16) since p17 very strong
]
;W[jd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White can pincer (like this) but a white position doesn't affect black's upper-right
 malf NR : but doesn't f17 make b flat?
 jansteen 3d*:  malf, f17, white c14, black k16 would give a nice balance
]
;B[cf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  enrico is right, good
 malf NR : f16
 jansteen 3d*:  Considering both sides, pls choose between d14 and f17
 ChickenJoe 4d :  agree club.
 jansteen 3d*:  Can you explain why, club
 ChickenJoe 4d :  C14 has C7 stones help so push on stronger stones first ...
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, correct, leaning against stronger position to attack weaker side more severely
]
;W[df]
;B[cc]
;W[dc]
;B[cd]
;W[ce]
;B[be]
;W[de]
;B[bf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, try the next move as well then ...
 jansteen 3d*:  Black f17 has a lot of life left, so white needs to strengthen somewhere, where?
 jansteen 3d*:  Forget about q10 for a while, enrico
 jansteen 3d*:  I want to adda move club, but where?
 malf NR : since w strong on bottom, f14/15
 jansteen 3d*:  If black f17 jumps out black can aim attack against k16 and aim d13, so white needs to act
 colombe 2d*: n17 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  enrico has right sense for direction, but c12 is not solid shape
 jansteen 3d*:  enrico, you leave cut with d13 later
]
;W[dh]C[
 colombe 2d*: d12 then
 jansteen 3d*:  Another basic move: connecting white's positions, having hands free to attack black freely would he decide to move
 jansteen 3d*:  Sorry Joe, did I give confusing comments?
 jansteen 3d*:  ok, Joe :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, next move club already commented correctly: f17 to move out
 jansteen 3d*:  How?
 jansteen 3d*:  Again a logical move
 jansteen 3d*:  Very basic
 malf NR : h15
 colombe 2d*: h15
 jansteen 3d*:  j16 is not logical
 jansteen 3d*:  h15 is possible I think
 jansteen 3d*:  sorry club :)
 jansteen 3d*:  j16 strengthens k16, but when black f17 is out you want to attack k16 :)
 jansteen 3d*:  malf severe :)
 c24 4k*:  h16?
]
;B[hd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This is logical, good c24
 jansteen 3d*:  Black creates eye-space
 jansteen 3d*:  Half is correct club :)
 malf NR : first half, j17
 c24 4k*:  also there is no good move around k16 for W?
 jansteen 3d*:  Well david, upper-edge is the hot area now, other places only have pure gote moves
 colombe 2d*: k14 first
 jansteen 3d*:  The one who does well at the top will do well in this game
]
;W[ic]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next black, club?
 colombe 2d*: because if j17 now, bl go out
 colombe 2d*: secong half k14
 malf NR : j17 make k16 very strong
 colombe 2d*: poor me
]
;B[hf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  A simple ikken-tobi, leaving h17 for eye shape and k15 for sabaki
]
;W[hc]C[
 malf NR : h17
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 c24 4k*:  f15 the shape
 jansteen 3d*:  f15 is not logical
 ChickenJoe 4d :  K14?
 jansteen 3d*:  f15 doesn't prevent connection, and is too close to white's wall
 malf NR : you said k15, but i don't see why
 jansteen 3d*:  well, k15 is emergency malf, for sabaki in case black gets into trouble
]
;B[jg]C[
 malf NR : ah
 jansteen 3d*:  Black flies graciously away
 colombe 2d*: i don't kib anylonger
 ChickenJoe 4d :  K14 not as good because "lock" shape heavy?
 colombe 2d*: n17 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  But connection doesn't affect black dsaun, pure endgame
 c24 4k*:  m3?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, colombe, pls promote yourself!
]
;W[mc]C[
 colombe 2d*: hehe
 jansteen 3d*:  White takes points while keeping eye on black's center
 jansteen 3d*:  Right Joe
 colombe 2d*: p15 is shape
 jansteen 3d*:  Now we come into the phase of the game where the minds start to make war
 malf NR : p15 seem automatic
 jansteen 3d*:  Black has a cute idea here: connect top and bottom....
]
;B[im]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move treatens g7 and has nice follow-up at j5 as well
 jansteen 3d*:  I didn't play this game, club :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Just trying to explain global story
 jansteen 3d*:  Never :)
]
;W[io]

 jansteen 3d*:  So both players show kiai here: go there own way....

 jansteen 3d*:  When I replay pro game I try to discover logic but maybe sometimes it's not there :)
 jansteen 3d*:  dsaun suggests some moves are intuitive, I agree
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's 43 created quite some trouble for white

 c24 4k*:  r10?
 ChickenJoe 4d :  R11/Q11

 fisica 6k*: higher is better here?

 jansteen 3d*:  r14 is very modest :)
 malf NR : r12
 jansteen 3d*:  fisica, high or low is always very difficult choice, but....
 jansteen 3d*:  Usually high promises another move, so low = 1 move, high = 2moves
 c24 4k*:  r10 to aggressive?
 jansteen 3d*:  Answer to original question is: "depends on score" :)
 fisica 6k*: thanks, jan. :)
 jansteen 3d*:  dsaun, you don't want to approach lower-side, it's extremely thick
 malf NR : r11 too close?
