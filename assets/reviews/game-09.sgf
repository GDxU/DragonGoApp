C[
 jansteen 3d*: This is the third game of this years Judan title match
 jansteen 3d*: The players are: Yoda Norimoto (b,9p) vs. Otake Hideo (w,9p)
 jansteen 3d*: In Chinese: Yi Tian Ji Ji (b,9p) vs. Da Zhu Ying Xiong (w,9p)
 jansteen 3d*: In some sense it's the "experienced" against the "new" in this game
 jansteen 3d*: Yoda has been promising for many years now but he never won one of the 7 major titles yet

 jansteen 3d*: This shape we analysed last time
 jansteen 3d*: It's remarkable how well the last game and this game fit each other
 wjl 4d*:  can u analyse it again?
 sli 2d*: we would like to see the analyse , jan :)
 jansteen 3d*: Oh, wjl, we discussed the merits of black f17 . You know that.
 jansteen 3d*: In that game white's next move was the same, where?
 niceguy 3d*: e17 then k16 standard move?
 jansteen 3d*: Close niceguy
 jansteen 3d*: I guess the audience is different from last time :-)
 niceguy 3d*: then e18 instead?
 jansteen 3d*: In the shape in upper-left, white's best move is d17
 jansteen 3d*: All other moves leave aji to exploit for black
]
;W[ic]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Where next?
 jansteen 3d*: White is attacking black, black has two approaches in such circumstances
 n1 2d*: n17
 jansteen 3d*: right n1!
 jansteen 3d*: Black combines various purposes with this move, seeking efficiency like with f17
]
;B[mc]
;W[qj]C[
 jansteen 3d*: This position is interesting as well, which tsume: r8 or r12 (and why)?
 wjl 4d*:  r8
 sli 2d*: r8 (r12 leave r17 good)
 joachim 2k*: r8 (inducing r16)
 niceguy 3d*: r8 since n17
 pem 25k*: from the weaker side.
 jansteen 3d*: r8 is correct
 jansteen 3d*: good arguments

 n1 2d*: s14
 cwrk 7k*: s14
 jansteen 3d*: right again, n1 and cwrk
]
;W[rf]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Usually white atari's first with q12 but then s14 will be less sente
 jansteen 3d*: Black might protect the corner in that case
 jansteen 3d*: next?
 n1 2d*: r11
 jansteen 3d*: good n1, you know! :-)
]
;B[qi]
;W[qc]C[
 jansteen 3d*: This invasion at (3,3) was the purpose of s14.

 jansteen 3d*: Reconsider l3, robert, while noticing white's strong position on the left.
]
;B[nq]C[
 n1 2d*: ?
 jansteen 3d*: Black exploits the thickness just created with r11
 jansteen 3d*: Both players are playing a tight game here.
 jansteen 3d*: Next move is predictable, where?
 niceguy 3d*: e17?
 sli 2d*: e17
 n1 2d*: e17
 jansteen 3d*: niceguy, I explained about the shape earlier :-)
]
;W[dc]C[
 Archadian 2d*: i like d17 since e17 leaves c17 for b later.
 jansteen 3d*: right, Archadian, white will feel uncomfortable with that time-bomb left behind
 jansteen 3d*: But maybe b16 (instead of c17) as aji though.
 jansteen 3d*: The people who saw the previous game with the left side shape remember the way how black deals with f17, how?
]
;B[ge]C[
 jansteen 3d*: All forgot about this shape? :-(
 jansteen 3d*: next move is also same as previous game, anyone remembers?
]
;W[ld]
;B[kb]
;W[jd]
;B[gg]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Easy going by both
 jansteen 3d*: White decides to leave the scene and play bottom now, which point?
 sli 2d*: m3?
 jansteen 3d*: m3 is kind of usual when left side as strong as here
 jansteen 3d*: In this case it might ask too much to convert lower right into territory though.
]
;W[kp]C[
 niceguy 3d*: This more a move to reduce thickness.
 jansteen 3d*: Agree niceguy, a balanced move.
 jansteen 3d*: Next move has been an important decision by black.
]

 jansteen 3d*: This move decides the middle game fighting patterns for this game.

;B[gp]
;W[gq]
;B[gn]
;W[lm]C[
 jansteen 3d*: White 46 (m7) is typical Otake style.
 jansteen 3d*: Relaxed, with power in store.
 newidea 1d*: R5?
 jansteen 3d*: very good newidea!

;B[qo]C[
 jansteen 3d*: White will undertake action now.

 jansteen 3d*: yes niceguy! :-)
]
;W[gi]
;B[ig]C[
 jansteen 3d*: next move is typical Otake again, any ideas?
 Votey 4d : h14?
 jansteen 3d*: h14 is Chinese or Korean style, not Otake :-)
]
;W[ie]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Creating eye shape while aiming at h14 as well.
]
;B[dg]
;W[df]C[
 jansteen 3d*: next move is interesting, hard to guess though.

;B[ek]C[
 pem 25k*: That's shape? Looks like an open triangle... :)
