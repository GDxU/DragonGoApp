 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 jansteen 3d*:  One of you is right

;W[jp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  d10 can not be bad?
 jansteen 3d*:  Or is k4 definitely bigger?
 jansteen 3d*:  ok
 jansteen 3d*:  Next then?
 climate 1k*:  c6
 jansteen 3d*:  One of you is right
 jansteen 3d*:  Usually, playing wider side in opening is common procedure, so k16 or f17
]
;B[cn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  c6 might be ok against Takemiya, trying to keep the game small scale

 jansteen 3d*:  Black plays catenacio joseki
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's shape very solid, seems ok
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move for white?
 jansteen 3d*:  (white agrees on small scale game)
 jansteen 3d*:  Please choose between o17 and r14 direction
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi malf
 jansteen 3d*:  White g6 here?
 malf NR : w has an extension at k4, seems g6 proper
 jansteen 3d*:  g6 is not good malf, g6 only gains some extra points but doesn't build a moyo nor attacks
 jansteen 3d*:  Pls choose bwteeen o17 or r14 direction here
 jansteen 3d*:  Hello jujo-sensei
 jansteen 3d*:  This is a lightning game, so pro's tend to play instinctive moves
 jansteen 3d*:  No one opts for r14 direction here?
 malf NR : i prefer o17
 jansteen 3d*:  o17 because it's the wider side?
]
;W[qi]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  I already gave away that Takemiya agreed to play small scale in this game :)
 jansteen 3d*:  r11 is marvelous point
 Io 26k : why is r11 marvelous
 jansteen 3d*:  r11 prevents black's ideal formation with r10
 jansteen 3d*:  It splits up black's forces along the right side
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, direction here: r9 or r13?
 jansteen 3d*:  pls check title, enrico
 haihe 2k*:  r5
 jansteen 3d*:  Which point, cut?
 jansteen 3d*:  Hmm, cut, better ask jujo this question
 malf NR : r13, playing m3 when w f8
 jansteen 3d*:  But to me, r11 looks bigger than o17
 jansteen 3d*:  Hard for white to build a moyo in upper-left with black strong in lowerleft
]
;B[qk]
;W[qf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  The difference between r10 and r11 might be very subtle
 jansteen 3d*:  I have to think longer to understand r11
 jansteen 3d*:  In this case there is an invasion point left at r7 for example
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, next black move?
 Mikehong NR : if r10,then w r8,that is normal.
 jansteen 3d*:  right homeless
]
;B[qe]
;W[pf]
;B[nd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  All normal
 jansteen 3d*:  White wants three points here: k17 direction, n3 direction and p11, which one?
 jansteen 3d*:  k17 doesn't affect black
 Io 26k : where is white weak, where is black weak, where is the territory
 jansteen 3d*:  p11 is a very solid way to play, preparing: r7 and r17 invasion
 jansteen 3d*:  p11 is a masterly move, feels good when you play it
 jansteen 3d*:  White played p11 but tried to gain efficiency
 jansteen 3d*:  Right sfo!
 Mikehong NR : play p11,then can choose k17 or n3
]
;W[lc]
;B[me]
;W[oi]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  A kind of inducing sequence
 malf NR : i thought m17 only for handi games?
 jansteen 3d*:  m17 fustrates black's f17 slightly and induces p11
 jansteen 3d*:  m17 is handicap style when played with the wrong idea in the head, malf
 jansteen 3d*:  m17 is not played to kill black's corner :)
 jansteen 3d*:  It is played to prevent black's natural development along the top
 Mikehong NR : p9?
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, what now?
 malf NR : l16
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, malf!
 Gy 3d : why jansteen vs jansteen? how can u do that?
 jansteen 3d*:  An attack of m17 seems natural here
]
;B[kd]
;W[qc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi shouzhuo
 jansteen 3d*:  r17 now is yosumi: testing black's response
 Gy 3d : who is teacher?
 jansteen 3d*:  A high level technique, trying to gain efficiency
 jansteen 3d*:  Gy, I replay, we discuss, no specific teacher
 jansteen 3d*:  No denots, what can I teach you?
 Gy 3d : jansteen is teacher, ic! hi, teacher
 jansteen 3d*:  Three ways for black here: r16, s15 and q17, pls choose one
 jansteen 3d*:  That's true, denots :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Why s15 denots?
 jansteen 3d*:  What's the intention of s15?
 WatchOnly NR : q17
 jansteen 3d*:  Same for q17, what's intention?
 jansteen 3d*:  And why, denots?
 WatchOnly NR : r16 then :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Right levner, s15 is played when attacking options still exist against r14 group
 jansteen 3d*:  q17 would be played when r14 alive and top big
 malf NR : seems p11 make s15 not urgent
 jansteen 3d*:  In this case....
]
;B[qd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Right malf, with p11 there s15 would leave white's r17 too lively
 jansteen 3d*:  Still r17 lots of aji (options) though
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, white to move with the m17 stone, what's shape?
 malf NR : k17
 jansteen 3d*:  You got another one, malf
]
;W[jc]C[
 malf NR : hope for me yet...
 jansteen 3d*:  This is Go basics: try to get ahead of the opponent when walking
 jansteen 3d*:  Next black?
 WatchOnly NR : j16
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, WatchOnly, same principle!
 ls NR : haha
]
;B[id]C[
 malf NR : j17
 jansteen 3d*:  This is a kind of standard procedure, including white's next move
 jansteen 3d*:  :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Time to cut now :)
]
;W[jd]
;B[je]
;W[ie]C[
 Io 26k : l17
 WatchOnly NR : g16
 jansteen 3d*:  This kind of fighting makes studying pro games very useful, it gives ideas
 jansteen 3d*:  More ideas than in the books
]
;B[ic]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  What now?
 taxi 6k*: L15 first?
 jansteen 3d*:  h15 tmartin, you're not worried about l17 gap?
 WatchOnly NR : k18
 jansteen 3d*:  Actually, this kind of position is *very* difficult
 jansteen 3d*:  So many possibilities
 jansteen 3d*:  No tmartin, you are right!
]
;W[he]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White's move is clear and simple: putting preasure on the cutting stones
 jansteen 3d*:  black pushing now with l17 doesn't work well because of l15 weakness
 jansteen 3d*:  No, white doesn't sacrifice two stones here
 jansteen 3d*:  How to capture them, enrico?
 jansteen 3d*:  Black now decides to close white in
]
;B[jb]
;W[kc]
;B[jf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White needs to strenghten top four stones here....
]
;W[nb]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  And black needs to save j16....
]
;B[gd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White could push and cut here, right?
 jansteen 3d*:  right, starting with h16
 malf NR : i like it :)
 jansteen 3d*:  The push and cut is dangerous for white
 jansteen 3d*:  Shall we see?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, sfo, q18 is the game
 jansteen 3d*:  Shall we see the cut?
 malf NR : i have the timing wrong again :(
 taxi 6k*: Yes please

 jansteen 3d*:  Now white has to prevent e17

;W[gg]C[
 taxi 6k*: g15?
 jansteen 3d*:  Which moment Egg?
 jansteen 3d*:  Many moves here which look extrenely dangerous for white
 jansteen 3d*:  Doesn't work Egg, as far as I can see (g15)
 jansteen 3d*:  Now g18?
 jansteen 3d*:  Oh, I see
]
;B[fg]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  p18 looks scary
 jansteen 3d*:  I feel black better in fight here, maybe also l18 enough for black
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, this is homework :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Not wall denots, g14 was still there
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, white lives
 jansteen 3d*:  Black needs a move at top noe, shape?
 jansteen 3d*:  now
 jansteen 3d*:  Not weak denots, but not wall either :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, f17 is efficient
 malf NR : f17 is a shape move
 jansteen 3d*:  e16 is denots style :)
 taxi 6k*: g15?
 jansteen 3d*:  e16 idea is to tickle corner while aiming at h15 stones
 jansteen 3d*:  Right malf, e16 very creative
 jansteen 3d*:  This move prevents white covering black with g15
 WatchOnly NR : f15?
 jansteen 3d*:  All natural moves, the groups start moving....
 jansteen 3d*:  If white l12, black's upper-right is very weak
 malf NR : i am surprised w leaves the step to d18 for b to play
 jansteen 3d*:  Not really malf
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's main aim was to split white's groups
 jansteen 3d*:  so he was too busy to take d18
 jansteen 3d*:  White's next move?
 taxi 6k*: h11?
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move will give some players "ah" emotion :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move is calmly, but also very severe and clear
 WatchOnly NR : m14
 malf NR : e17 :)
]
;W[ec]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, yes!
 jansteen 3d*:  Black has two weak groups now: g16 and q16 group
 jansteen 3d*:  Of course, white made sure black cannot capture the cutting stones around j15
 jansteen 3d*:  g16 is a weak group Egg
 malf NR : g16 not have proper eye shape
 jansteen 3d*:  How to live with g16?
 jansteen 3d*:  Base only is one eye
 malf NR : b can be cut
 jansteen 3d*:  Right denots, pls explain
 jansteen 3d*:  or malf
 malf NR : w f18
 jansteen 3d*:  Right denots
 jansteen 3d*:  and malf :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, I continue

 malf NR : protect the cut? e18?
 jansteen 3d*:  agree denots, hard to understand

 jansteen 3d*:  Good robertm!

;B[kj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White treatened to play here himself

;W[fd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This white move is very severe

 jansteen 3d*:  ok, black alive then
 dasch 3d*: hi jan :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi David :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move? Global, with multiple meaning
 imp NR : hi all
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, p9, good
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi imp :)
 imp NR : late, sorry:)
 jansteen 3d*:  p9 is key point, shouldn't miss this kind of move
 jansteen 3d*:  Three meanings: 1. attack's black's top, 2. defends white's p11 3. aims lower-right invasion
 jansteen 3d*:  Usually a move with three meanings is ok :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move is very much pro standard
 fisica 6k*: but how to choose from, for example, p9 and o9, Jan?
 jansteen 3d*:  o9 instead of p9 would be less effective for later r8, fisica
 fisica 6k*: thanks, Jan and Chicken.
 jansteen 3d*:  Instead of defending black's center, black attacks white's center and thus....
 jansteen 3d*:  indirectly makes own center stronger
 jansteen 3d*:  Besides, g6 has h4 bonus later
 imp NR : moreover: k7 direction too vague (no follow-ups)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 jansteen 3d*:  If l8 works it would be great
 imp NR : k8 other option
 imp NR : sorry k7
 jansteen 3d*:  You all play correct direction
 jansteen 3d*:  imp got it :)

 jansteen 3d*:  Ah, ok enrico
 jansteen 3d*:  In that case you should try to appreciate black's next move
 eagl 4k*: h5?
 jansteen 3d*:  p8 would try too much with one stone, the risk is that you don't accomplish any of them
 imp NR : q7 maybe?
 malf NR : just l7?

;B[qm]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move prtects territory solidly
