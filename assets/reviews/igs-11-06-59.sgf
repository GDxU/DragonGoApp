;B[mg]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Building right side, aiming top as well
 jansteen 3d*:  Time for white to invade, ideas?
 colombe 2d*: p10
 colombe 2d*: now white has to invade
 jansteen 3d*:  p10 is one idea, agree
 colombe 2d*: or o10
 colombe 2d*: or q10, i dunno :)
 colombe 2d*: but i bet on 10 !
 jansteen 3d*:  You're suggesting erasing moves, not really invading moves
 colombe 2d*: may be p9
 imp NR : r12 possible?
 colombe 2d*: oh i see
 colombe 2d*: q13
 jansteen 3d*:  When deciding which erasing move is best imagine which move would make the moyo territory
 jansteen 3d*:  Usually that's also the point you want to take to erase
 jansteen 3d*:  White goes in deeper, invasion
 jansteen 3d*:  The choice makes sense once you see it
 jansteen 3d*:  Consider all stones
 colombe 2d*: r17 ?
 imp NR : i would like to q11, but that erases:)
 colombe 2d*: r12 ?
 colombe 2d*: ok we're all bad, show us, jan :)
 jansteen 3d*:  q11 seems easy to deal with for black
 jansteen 3d*:  r12 seems too deep to me
 imp NR : q7 ineresting...
]
;W[pm]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes imp!
 jansteen 3d*:  q7 uses fact that ladder is good for white + it uses l4
