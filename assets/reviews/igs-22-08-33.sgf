 jansteen 3d*:  Hi all, this is my birthday celebration game :)
 jansteen 3d*:  one minute pls...
 imp NR : congratulations jan! :)

 jansteen 3d*:  This game is a special event, Japanese like that
 suzhou 2k*: b good:)
 jansteen 3d*:  So the players are sitting on the stage, 400 people watching them
 jansteen 3d*:  Very uncomfortable it seems, but pro's are used to it
 jansteen 3d*:  During the game it's analysed and players even can hear the comments
 imp NR : must be painfull to blunder then:)
 jansteen 3d*:  But they are usually 100percent concentrated anyway so no problem
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, imp, sometimes painful :)
 jansteen 3d*:  But collegue pro commentators are very political :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next game might be other way around... :)

 jansteen 3d*:  Use translate pls monet2
 jansteen 3d*:  malf, c10 seems overlapping with c6, other options?
 jansteen 3d*:  No, direction was ok
 imp NR : f16?
 jansteen 3d*:  What's white's threat here
 imp NR : oh, d10 then?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, c9 worse than c10 :)
 jansteen 3d*:  d10 is unusual shape imp, sometimes d11 is shape
 imp NR : yes right
 dniles 13k :  What abou the simple C11?
 imp NR : c11 something?
 jansteen 3d*:  c11 would locally be best, but game is better :)
 jansteen 3d*:  c11 is farest away from c6 malf
 jansteen 3d*:  c10 is loose
 imp NR : e12
 jansteen 3d*:  But, what's white's threat, when black tenuki on left?
 dniles 13k :  E12 seems to hvae fighting spirit.
 jansteen 3d*:  yes, imp!
 jansteen 3d*:  good dniles
 imp NR : which is not w treat btw:)
 jansteen 3d*:  e12 anticipates white's d10

 jansteen 3d*:  I like next move
 imp NR : he, would expect f17 instead of e17
 jansteen 3d*:  It's vital point for power
 dniles 13k :  J18 here feels too slow.
 jansteen 3d*:  imp, black was alreay planning next move
 imp NR : f12
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, good feeling imp
]
;B[fh]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  suddenly all white stones unhappy
 imp NR : slow but powerfull
 jansteen 3d*:  Imagine when white is allowed nidan-bane at this point
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes malf, but we do :)
 dniles 13k :  what is nidan-bane, it didn't translate?
 jansteen 3d*:  Now, what's black's price to pay?
 iota NR : translate nidan  by itself
 jansteen 3d*:  nidan-bane is hane, hane, hane
 enh 5k*:  q4
 jansteen 3d*:  We learned from previous pro games there is always a price
 jansteen 3d*:  How to let black pay for this point?
 imp NR : nice: all w stones seem to shrink away:)
 Grandad 6k*: e6?
 jansteen 3d*:  e6 is defensive Grandad
 iota NR : q4
 jansteen 3d*:  d7 is interesting, but panicy
 enh 5k*:  c8
 jansteen 3d*:  Think: black usually would defend top instead of f12
 enh 5k*:  d8

 jansteen 3d*:  I was afraid of that question :)
 imp NR : what a strange order of moves...
 jansteen 3d*:  To explain the corner I have to show many moves
 jansteen 3d*:  So I tried to skip it :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Is that ok?
 jansteen 3d*:  Homework? :)
 imp NR : well, it's your party:)
 jansteen 3d*:  thanks imp, good sport :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Anyway, black's capture in sente with f16 allows another tenuki
]
;B[nc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  So now white has risk to fall behind in territory
 imp NR : to me, b is leading much
 jansteen 3d*:  Consequently he invades left side, suggestions pls :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, levner, good
]
;W[cl]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next black move is for you to guess, a beer for correct answer
 imp NR : how many guesses?
 jansteen 3d*:  has to do with status of top black group
 imp NR : :)
 jansteen 3d*:  imp: 3 each
 jansteen 3d*:  I forget about b4
 enh 5k*:  . d7?
 jansteen 3d*:  didn't see correct move yet
 jansteen 3d*:  Remembe rthe hin tmalf
 imp NR : c9
 jansteen 3d*:  Sorry: remember the hint malf
 enh 5k*:  d9
 jansteen 3d*:  Hint: is white m17 sente?
 iota NR : definitely
 jansteen 3d*:  right
 imp NR : b19
 jansteen 3d*:  Hint: is white n17 sente?
 imp NR : b18
 jansteen 3d*:  Think more towards the center imp
 iota NR : e19 assures life, but there's probably a more elegant way
 imp NR : that was third:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes malf :)
 iota NR : l18, yeah
 jansteen 3d*:  10 seconds...
 jansteen 3d*:  5...
 iota NR : j15
 jansteen 3d*:  yes!
 enh 5k*:  e7

;B[ie]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  There goes a beer! :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's philosphy: white n17 sente on my top group...
 imp NR : congrat. iota; those beers are not easy to earn:)
 jansteen 3d*:  so I want to defend it...
 jansteen 3d*:  So let's destroy white's shape before doing so....
 jansteen 3d*:  Kind of: Kikashi before living
]
;W[lc]
;B[ea]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black j15 was very much admired and appreciated by audience and commentator
 jansteen 3d*:  Of course there is a price :)
 jansteen 3d*:  White sente and able to play again on left side
 iota NR : It's gratifying to know I might eventually be good at this game :) (20k* now)

 imp NR : you can be sure to progress iota:)
 jansteen 3d*:  When we meet someday I owe you a beer iota :)

;W[if]C[
 iota NR : ok :)
 jansteen 3d*:  White takes care of h16 cutting point
 jansteen 3d*:  Black to attack left side stones, how to proceed?
 jansteen 3d*:  (no beer, standard procedure...)
 iota NR : hee hee
 imp NR : e7?
 jansteen 3d*:  Consider strength of c6, is it strong?
 imp NR : sorry, d7
 jansteen 3d*:  e7 is correct idea: strengthen c6
 jansteen 3d*:  d7 same idea: strengthen c6 and thus weaken white's group on left side
 imp NR : hmm, c4?
 jansteen 3d*:  e6 normal move, but missing suji move
 jansteen 3d*:  yes, c4 is suji here
]
;B[cp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  idea: keep white busy in the corner while gaining strength to attack left more seriously
]
;W[cq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 imp NR : d5
 jansteen 3d*:  yes
]
;B[do]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black b3 would be the move for settling, this move is for attacking

 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 jansteen 3d*:  Won and lost :)
 jansteen 3d*:  I played 3-2, games were ok I think
 jansteen 3d*:  e4 is one suggestion, others?
 imp NR : b5
 jansteen 3d*:  yes, b5
]
;B[bo]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Look at white's c8 and c11, they almost died
 jansteen 3d*:  right shouzhuo, b5 is a 100 percent no-no

 jansteen 3d*:  sorry, c5
 jansteen 3d*:  right imp :)

;W[hh]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, shouzhuo :)
 jansteen 3d*:  A very nice point, mutual power point, comparable with e12 earlier

 jansteen 3d*:  Yes imp, any favorite point? :)
 bada 3d : near q4 or f6 or r14? :-)
 jansteen 3d*:  Why p4 shouzhuo?
 imp NR : r5
 jansteen 3d*:  ok
 colombe 2d*: hi all; i'm late
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi colombe :)

 colombe 2d*: hi hi, cui cui all

;W[pp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White I mean, sorry
 bada 3d : well, nothing unusual it seems
 iota NR : interesting how only 3 stones in right diagonal half of board
 imp NR : r6 now?
 jansteen 3d*:  Next black move very fascinating
 jansteen 3d*:  A kikashi
 colombe 2d*: g4 ????
 jansteen 3d*:  Very close colombe!
 bada 3d : f9?
]
;B[fo]C[
 colombe 2d*: f9 close to g4 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  This makes white feel uncomfortable
 bada 3d : f5 is good (after the fact) ;-)
 colombe 2d*: not really a kikashi
 bada 3d : f9 was too early
 jansteen 3d*:  g3 a threat now, but also (later) g10
 colombe 2d*: i have the saying for you from a pro :
 jansteen 3d*:  pls colombe...
 colombe 2d*: the difference from a kikashi and a bad move is a paper thin
 colombe 2d*: :)
 imp NR : :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Maitre Lim ?
 colombe 2d*: no, no, a jap. pro
 jansteen 3d*:  Very interesting :)
]
;W[iq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move protects g3
]
;B[qn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  r6 natural
]
;W[np]C[
 bada 3d : now r6 makes sense since w is low
]
;B[qk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black plays solid because of white's center power
 imp NR : now, r5 or not?
 bada 3d : something in UR corner for sure
 jansteen 3d*:  r5 doesn't gain much
 bada 3d : r15?
 imp NR : r14
 jansteen 3d*:  r5, q6 exchange makes black strong, and corner still thin
 bada 3d : r14 invites b r12 which is ideal
 imp NR : then r17...
 jansteen 3d*:  anna: one of them lost on time, let me check...
 bada 3d : perhaps something on the 4th line (q14 or something)
 imp NR : b (NaiWei) lost on time
 jansteen 3d*:  Black lost on time
 YI 2k*: e5
 yaowin 3k*:  q10?
 jansteen 3d*:  White to invade right side
 jansteen 3d*:  Which point will you chose?
 bada 3d : let's go, jansteen :-)
 imp NR : its between r11 and r14 for me:)
 yaowin 3k*:  p15?
 jansteen 3d*:  r11 is not good
 yaowin 3k*:  r11, B has s4
 jansteen 3d*:  sorry :)
 colombe 2d*: g8
 imp NR : still prefer r14:)
 jansteen 3d*:  yes, imp, good point!
]
;W[qf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Always look for moves which create two follow-up moves
 bada 3d : why is r14 good since b can play r12?
 jansteen 3d*:  What are the folow-up moves of this move, imp?
 colombe 2d*: r17 and r11
 imp NR : r11 and r17
 jansteen 3d*:  yes, good :)
]
;B[qh]C[
 imp NR : well, b looses corner, but outside interesting then
 bada 3d : i don't like w r14 - it doesn't fit moyo flow
 jansteen 3d*:  Of course, since players are professional, they confuse us by exchanging kikashi first...
]
;W[pk]C[
 colombe 2d*: difficult for white to build moyo here

 imp NR : and now b does not choose standard answer (q16) to r17:)
 jansteen 3d*:  end of white's sabaki...
 jansteen 3d*:  agree, white seems too good here
 bada 3d : doesn't look like first rate game by either player
 jansteen 3d*:  bada, are you kidding? :)
 bada 3d : well, from my perspective that's my impression
 bada 3d : clearly there are some first rate pro games and some average etc.
 YI 2k*: b p14 is bad
 bada 3d : this ranks as average or below in my opinion
 jansteen 3d*:  bada: a small anekdote
 imp NR : seems that w gets a good result by first kikashi
 iota NR : I could beat either player, if I could play 2 moves every turn
 imp NR : whatever b does
 iota NR : :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Once my wife asked Miyamoto Naoki: ....
 jansteen 3d*:  "We can not see difference between 10 and 20 kyu..."
 jansteen 3d*:  "What difference do you see between 5kyu and 5dan?"
 bada 3d : seems b must prevent w from makeing too much in center
 jansteen 3d*:  Miyamoto answered: "none" :)
 suzhou 2k*: no difer:)
 jansteen 3d*:  So, when we try to seperate good pro games from bad go games, that feels funny :)
 bada 3d : cute story - but not very interesting in my opinion
 yaowin 3k*:  I am glad to hear that
 bada 3d : no i think separating good pro games from bad ones is not too hard
 suzhou 2k*: if I said so, you guys would think it's bullshi.., but since it's from Miyamoto, pelple like to quote it:)
 bada 3d : in korea (on baduk cable), it gets done all the time
 imp NR : shall we go on?
 bada 3d : i agree with shouzhuo - i have high respect for most though
 yaowin 3k*:  q11?
 imp NR : let's see if b can do something back:)
 bada 3d : those trying to be too cute, i don't especially like...
 bada 3d : anyhow, time to get back to game :-)
 bada 3d : p14 stone is too heavy not to sacrifice somehow?
 suzhou 2k*: p11?
 jansteen 3d*:  Well, in my opinion there is a huge gap between these 9p's and us

;B[nf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Well, in my opinion there is a huge gap between these 9p's and us
 bada 3d : g10 now perhaps as indirect way of shrinking w?
 jansteen 3d*:  Although we watch the same position we see different things
 jansteen 3d*:  The flow we can understand, but the action behind the scene is very tough
