 colombe 2d*: c12
 CWine 2d :  Biggest vacuum left of Q16.
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, colombe, immediately

 jansteen 3d*:  Good balance on the left side
 colombe 2d*: when strong, choose the most powerful pincer
 jansteen 3d*:  Black plays tenuki (elsewhere), where? :)
 colombe 2d*: the most  'mechant'
 colombe 2d*: r8

 jansteen 3d*:  Why okeima shimari, club?
 colombe 2d*: with o17
 jansteen 3d*:  n17 is big-keima shimari :)
 CWine 2d :  Formula would be R15 hoping for answer on right, but W wouldn't answer on right.
 jansteen 3d*:  o17 is small-keima (kogeima) shimari
 jansteen 3d*:  I see
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, I think n17 is possible

 jansteen 3d*:  Next black? (last big point)
 kawasaki NR : k17?

 colombe 2d*: or p8
 jansteen 3d*:  kawasaki got it
]
;B[jd]C[
 kawasaki NR : hm... high, not low... to make it easier to run c14?
 colombe 2d*: high to make balance
 CWine 2d :  C14 stunted, if W wants.
 colombe 2d*: white won't play low because f17
 jansteen 3d*:  k17/o17 formation is very low, therefor k16, balance
 colombe 2d*: hei, jan sensei !
 jansteen 3d*:  Later black can try to close top with sente starting with g17 for example
 jansteen 3d*:  What colombe? :)
 CWine 2d :  Now vacuum on bottom, though I'm looking at D10.
 jansteen 3d*:  China-Japan Youth match, 3rd game: Yo Kagen (8 dan,B) vs Zhou Heyang (7 dan,W)
 kawasaki NR : hm... f7?
 kawasaki NR : play on border of spheres of influence?
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, the game begins now, white to invade the bottom, ideas where to start?
 kawasaki NR : hm, if invading... k4 seems about right
 jansteen 3d*:  kawasaki, it's white to play
 hmy 1k : o4
 kawasaki NR : yes, I was thinking white f7... but for invasion k4
 colombe 2d*: f6 ?
 kawasaki NR : l3 seems too deep
 jansteen 3d*:  o4 is traditional weakness, agree, a good point to aim at
 jansteen 3d*:  colombe, white invades deeper
 colombe 2d*: k1 ?
 colombe 2d*: :)
 CWine 2d :  Closer to R than left.
 colombe 2d*: o3
 jansteen 3d*:  When looking for invasion points, you look for points with two follow-up moves
 net 1k*: f8?
 jansteen 3d*:  k1 too deep colombe :)
 kawasaki NR : like k4 -- can play n3 or g4 as follow ups
 hmy 1k : p2
 Ipanema 1d*: r3?
 colombe 2d*: hum, o3 then
 CWine 2d :  M3, with choices of J3 or M6 as next move.

;W[lp]C[
 colombe 2d*: this, deep ?
 kawasaki NR : the 3rd line too dep
 colombe 2d*: for pro it's deep, for me, it's like flying, like colombe :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Black doesn't see a good way to attack this stone
 jansteen 3d*:  So black plays tenuki, where?
 colombe 2d*: r15 !

 jansteen 3d*:  yes!

 colombe 2d*: ho ho, i was kidding with club :)

;B[km]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black is looking seriously at m4 now, time to make sabaki
 colombe 2d*: :)
 CWine 2d :  Just joking, columbe, english ambiguous, but one definition of strong is "smell bad".
 colombe 2d*: huh ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move is another of those: "who guesses it gets a beer" moves
 colombe 2d*: n7
 jansteen 3d*:  yes
 jansteen 3d*:  p2 interesting jones
 hmy 1k : n7
 jansteen 3d*:  o3 traditional move here I think
 colombe 2d*: o3
 colombe 2d*: q3
 colombe 2d*: bet
 CWine 2d :  With the hint, I was looking at M7, a really off-the-wall move.
 jansteen 3d*:  q3 comparable to p2
 colombe 2d*: r5

 jansteen 3d*:  Black playes a very leasury attack here
 colombe 2d*: black wants sente to play q11
 CWine 2d :  Attack is on R10 group, this is maneuvering for strenght.
 jansteen 3d*:  Black gained strength in lower-right and decides to attack right side group
