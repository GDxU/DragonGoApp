 jansteen 3d*:  c3 or c4 malf?
 jansteen 3d*:  Which ladder malf?
 jansteen 3d*:  I see, no, you can play c3 even if d7 can be captured in a shichi
 jansteen 3d*:  shicho
 jansteen 3d*:  In this position black probably didn't like white to get thick at the left
 jansteen 3d*:  So black settled there himself with c4

 jansteen 3d*:  I would think so too, but...
]
;B[dl]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, agree with both of you

 jansteen 3d*:  g9 marvelous point, but...
]
;W[bk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This point also very big
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's group is at stake here
 J4 2d*: D3?
 jansteen 3d*:  No, black didn't cut, let me think why not
 jansteen 3d*:  Black played b3
 J4 2d*: why D3 doesnot work, pls?
 jansteen 3d*:  I don't know J4 :)
 firefly 1d : b wanted sente?
 jansteen 3d*:  I'm thinking for a reason
 J4 2d*: a lot of calculations after D3.
 landon 11k*: i am only 11k, but doesnt d3 end up killing f3?
 jansteen 3d*:  I think sente is indeed the reason for not playing d3
 jansteen 3d*:  I can not think of other reasons
]
;B[bq]C[
 J4 2d*: it seems W can B3, it's a ko.
 jansteen 3d*:  How does white defend against d2 now?
 J4 2d*: no, of course D2 first, then B3.
 J4 2d*: it's a ko, right, jan?
 jansteen 3d*:  But then black lives with a6, no?
 J4 2d*: yeah, then W can A2?
 J4 2d*: not good for W?
 jansteen 3d*:  Hmm, don't like it for white, black can h4 and attack the wall
 J4 2d*: yes, u are right.
 jansteen 3d*:  How to defend here against black d2?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right
]
;W[dr]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Taking f9 is slow, malf
 J4 2d*: W B2 is sente, right?
 jansteen 3d*:  Now a fight starts at the bottom
 jansteen 3d*:  Right
 lohua 3k*: Is this Chang-lee game?
 J4 2d*: B h4 now?
 jansteen 3d*:  Black l3, then white will r3 I think, settling
 jansteen 3d*:  Black l3 will then turn out weaker than surrounding white groups
 jansteen 3d*:  Black decided lighter approach....
 jansteen 3d*:  Ideas?
 jansteen 3d*:  45th NHK, 1st rnd, 12th gm: Nishida Terumi (B,5p) vs Ishii Kunio (W,9p)
 jansteen 3d*:  It's similar to h4
 firefly 1d : b j4?
]
;B[io]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Aiming k3 and h3
]
;W[kq]
;B[no]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Aiming connection of all stones building up upper-right moyo
 jansteen 3d*:  So next white move is obligatory, which?
 jansteen 3d*:  Split with r11 would be a good anticipation move
 jansteen 3d*:  White's move is more challenging though
]
;W[ko]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Disturbing black's position, and creating weaknesses to look at for later on
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi booboo
]
;B[hq]C[
 J4 2d*: fraglant booboo? :-)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move is important too, shouldn't miss it :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Which one?
 jansteen 3d*:  b2 is white's priviledge, but was played later on
 jansteen 3d*:  I'm looking for a strategic move
 jansteen 3d*:  It's simple once you see it :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Not live, booboo
 firefly 1d : h7?
 J4 2d*: just J4?
]
;W[hm]C[

;B[jm]C[
 J4 2d*: yes, after your explanation, it's all clear. thx.
]
;W[mn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Complicated now
 jansteen 3d*:  In such circumstances look for weakest group and strengthen it
 jansteen 3d*:  What's black's weakest group now?
 colombe 2d*: f10 ?
 J4 2d*: E12?
 J4 2d*: oh, L8?
 colombe 2d*: yes
 jansteen 3d*:  f10 is in the open
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, k7 group needs attention
 jansteen 3d*:  Black does so with a tesuji
 colombe 2d*: l7 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  (to gain tempo)
 colombe 2d*: k9

;B[lm]
;W[km]
;B[jl]
;W[ik]
;B[kl]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Nice combination
 jansteen 3d*:  Now what's white's weakest?
 J4 2d*: Chang Hao lost to Lee?
 J4 2d*: by 1:2
 jansteen 3d*:  l3 group is weakest
 jansteen 3d*:  So next one does also make sense
]
;W[ll]C[
 colombe 2d*: o2 ? seeking for base ?
 J4 2d*: Chang lost to Lee by 1:2, mobil.
 ChickenJoe 4d :  m9, n8
 jansteen 3d*:  Now usual procedure is l10 leaving n7 aji
 jansteen 3d*:  But since it's a lightning game black took her chances immediately

;W[gm]
;B[nq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  o3 strengthens the corner while creating m6 option

;W[lk]
;B[jj]
;W[lj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Aiming capture of n7
