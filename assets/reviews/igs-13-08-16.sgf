;B[qe]C[

;B[hf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move is important, where?
 colombe 2d*: e17 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  e17 is correct "direction", but not most efficient
 colombe 2d*: or n17
 colombe 2d*: d18 ?
]
;W[ci]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move prevents black's very annoying c12 kakari (attack)
 jansteen 3d*:  It's in combination with white's invasion at the top a complete sequence
]
;B[fq]
;W[ip]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Which joseki should black choose here?
 jansteen 3d*:  f5, c6, h5 or c3?
 colombe 2d*: dunno
 Grandad 6k*: c6
 jansteen 3d*:  Consider whole board turtle
 jansteen 3d*:  Grandad is correct
 chouette NR : f5 mapping a big framework?
 jansteen 3d*:  SOrry, Grandad is not correct, chouette is
]
;B[fo]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This stone makes all black stones on right side work
 colombe 2d*: chouette is another french bird
 jansteen 3d*:  White j4 suddenly in a black sea
 chouette NR : uhu
 jansteen 3d*:  chouette = small stone?
]
;W[eq]
;B[fr]C[
 colombe 2d*: chouette is like hibou
]
;W[dn]C[
 colombe 2d*: j6
 jansteen 3d*:  I don't know the word hibou
 jansteen 3d*:  Next black move?
 colombe 2d*: if not j6, i give away 1d*
 colombe 2d*: oupss wait
 jansteen 3d*:  I wait ....
 colombe 2d*: l3 first ?
 chouette NR : chouette=owl
 jansteen 3d*:  I agree with l3 direction but I have a tip for you....
 colombe 2d*: difficult btw
 colombe 2d*: c5 first ?
 jansteen 3d*:  If you are choosing between l3 or l4 play the high one when there is no good reason for the low one
 jansteen 3d*:  So, in this case low or high?
 colombe 2d*: low
 jansteen 3d*:  Good turtle!
 jansteen 3d*:  So l4 then?
 Grandad 6k*: high cos of r5
 colombe 2d*: g4
 jansteen 3d*:  No Grandad, high because of f2
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, high is correct, now choose between l4 and m4
]
;B[lp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This choice is partly feeling but also another reason
 colombe 2d*: the corner ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Since black's lower-right quite open, black doesn't want to spend too many extra moves
 jansteen 3d*:  Right colombe
 jansteen 3d*:  Black wants *one* extra move
 jansteen 3d*:  With l4 you need two extra moves
 jansteen 3d*:  Therefore a little bit more distance
 jansteen 3d*:  White's next acknowledges black's potential in lower-right
 colombe 2d*: j6 for white ?
 jansteen 3d*:  He starts a very nice sabaki manoeuvre leading to high-light of this game
 jansteen 3d*:  Pls try to find a move in lower-right with a clear miai meaning
 jansteen 3d*:  Not j6 colombe, a small combination
 colombe 2d*: o3 making miai of m3 and r3 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Good!!
]
;W[nq]
;B[pq]

;B[mr]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black fights back as hard as possible
 jansteen 3d*:  So, white to play here, which one?
 colombe 2d*: j6 ?
 Grandad 6k*: o5
 colombe 2d*: or o6

;W[mp]
;B[mo]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 siedler 3d*: hi Jan :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi siedler
 colombe 2d*: o4
 jansteen 3d*:  right!

;W[np]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Using all stones locally
 colombe 2d*: geta then

 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 Grandad 6k*: must o7
 colombe 2d*: cut is overplay ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, good
]
;B[nm]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Cut has to, was planned when black played n6
 jansteen 3d*:  In a position like this one shouldn't panic
 jansteen 3d*:  q6 is good idea, trying to keep corner busy while aiming at o8 or escape
]
;W[qn]
;B[om]
;W[po]
;B[qp]
;W[pm]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black cannot cut now because of ladder, so....
]
;B[ok]
;W[pp]
;B[qq]
;W[qk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White managed to get around the o7 stone
 jansteen 3d*:  But anyway, the o7 cut is very severe on white
]
;B[on]
;W[pn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 jansteen 3d*:  (only move)
 suzhou 3k*: q10?
 colombe 2d*: r10 is severest
 suzhou 3k*: o2?
 jansteen 3d*:  q10 is soft, white can r10 and slide
 colombe 2d*: or atacking m7
 siedler 3d*: r 11
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, r11 is severe
]
;B[qi]C[
 suzhou 3k*: ya
 jansteen 3d*:  Preventing white to make a base for this group, driving it out
]
;W[pj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 siedler 3d*: n9
 jansteen 3d*:  Good siedler!
]
;B[mk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Nice sequence by black
 jansteen 3d*:  Make own position strong and make opponent feel weak and treatened
 suzhou 3k*: q11
 jansteen 3d*:  Of course n9 is also aiming at attack on lower-side (bottom) white group

 jansteen 3d*:  Next move looks very aggressive :)

 colombe 2d*: o11 ?
 Grandad 6k*: m10
 siedler 3d*: t4
 suzhou 3k*: h4or h5?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, suzhou
]
;W[hp]C[
 suzhou 3k*: hahaha, what a guess:)))
 jansteen 3d*:  Aiming h6 capture and j2
 suzhou 3k*: since w has p2 already
 colombe 2d*: h5 not work ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Otake Hideo is from
 jansteen 3d*:              12/05/1942
 colombe 2d*: black h5 now
 colombe 2d*: no, sorry
]
;B[in]
;W[ir]C[
 suzhou 3k*: cool
 jansteen 3d*:  Yuki is known for his extremely aggressive style
 colombe 2d*: semeai ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Compromise is a word not found in his dictionary
 suzhou 3k*: hmm, sure he is
 jansteen 3d*:  People in Kansai district adore him for this

 suzhou 3k*: k1?
 jansteen 3d*:  k1, then white happy with f4 connection
 joachim 3k*: g5
 jansteen 3d*:  When white gets f4 then black's stones are drifting in the center
]
;B[gp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  g5 right idea, but taking liberty is essential here

 joachim 3k*: seems so :-)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 suzhou 3k*: seki?

;W[so]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White t7 is simple, since black's coner is dead shape

 joachim 3k*: o17
 suzhou 3k*: b gained a lot
 colombe 2d*: ok go and sleep now bye all
 jansteen 3d*:  Who gained in this fight? :)
 jansteen 3d*:  colombe, in one hour live pro game on IGS!
 suzhou 3k*: but w's L7 group is 70% dead
 jansteen 3d*:  Otake Hideo (9p,B) vs Yuki Satoshi (8p,W)
 joachim 3k*: Otake is happy, he likes thickness
 jansteen 3d*:  ok, answer: black slightly better in this position
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move?
 jansteen 3d*:  (black to use thickness)
 suzhou 3k*: maybe lack in cash, but b has lots investment there :)
 suzhou 3k*: long term investements:)

 jansteen 3d*:  This move is a testing move

 jansteen 3d*:  (Yuki-style)
 suzhou 3k*: q16
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes :)

 suzhou 3k*: gee, I am not aggressive:)
 jansteen 3d*:  This move splits up black's position completely
 jansteen 3d*:  Right side and top

 suzhou 3k*: around c8,9 d8,9 area:)
 joachim 3k*: e7

 jansteen 3d*:  Considering this is a lightning game the players have to access position quickly
 jansteen 3d*:  One reason for *not* invading left side is....
 suzhou 3k*: is this quick game?
 jansteen 3d*:  c2 is open, and c17 still open
 jansteen 3d*:  Next white move is not an automatic one, but considers the main area, ideas?
 suzhou 3k*: jan's comments is cool

 jansteen 3d*:  Next move?
 jansteen 3d*:  enrico, you commented both corners were open, very good!
 jansteen 3d*:  And about your last question: d10 was considered "overplay" by the commentary
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, dahui :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Instead of d10 black should have enclosed the center in a safe way
 jansteen 3d*:  f10 too aggresive dahui, try again (direction is ok)
 jansteen 3d*:  Zal ik een zin Nederlands praten? Of jullie dat nou echt leuk vinden... :)
 jansteen 3d*:  and?
 jansteen 3d*:  g8 leaves a cutting point
 jansteen 3d*:  f8 as well
 jansteen 3d*:  I mean f9 as wel

 joachim 3k*: nothing can be done from now on
