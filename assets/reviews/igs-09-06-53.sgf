 jansteen 3d*:  How's the score?
 yaowin 3k*:  b has about 60?
 yaowin 3k*:  or more?
 twofar NR : b by 10
 DoctorGO NR : B about 77
 jansteen 3d*:  Correct, white resigned here
 DoctorGO NR : w about 65
 shimari 2k*: b win about 15.5 (if komi is 5.5)
 yaowin 3k*:  b less than 50, I think
 jansteen 3d*:  yaowin means white
 DoctorGO NR : interesting observation. :)
 yaowin 3k*:  Yeah, thx jan, I always make mis like that
 jansteen 3d*:  Upper-left seemed like a huge success for black
 wrferrer 10k*:  seems black ahead by 8-12 points
 DoctorGO NR : agree.
 shimari 2k*: u include komi there? that is a bold statement then denots :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Also black's tenuki's in lower-left worked out very well
 DoctorGO NR : by the way, I am late here, who are playing this game?
 jansteen 3d*:  Black came back much later and got a huge corner
 jansteen 3d*:  Right denots :)
 DoctorGO NR : B neglect F3 early interesting.
 yaowin 3k*:  w make a wrong ko threat at B 18, I think
 jansteen 3d*:  White's ko treat in lower-right turned out to become small endgame
 jansteen 3d*:  I think this was not a very good game by Imamura
 jansteen 3d*:  I will try to find a better game by him next time
 jansteen 3d*:  White b18 was ok treat, but he probably felt he was behind so he tried lower-right
 jansteen 3d*:  White didn't have any substantial treats at that point
 jansteen 3d*:  right tmartin
 DoctorGO NR : thx jan.
 jansteen 3d*:  Sure, next time we go slower again :)
 jansteen 3d*:  thanks for watching
