C[ jansteen 3d*: Now black has two moves: c18 and b16. Which one in this case?
 maestro NR :  c18 seems ok
 jansteen 3d*: When playing c18 you always have to consider the white move at b15 later on
 jansteen 3d*: Usually c18 is bad when black doesn't have a stone around c11
 jansteen 3d*: however...]
;
B[cb]
C[ jansteen 3d*: next move?
 maestro NR : h17?
 prettygirl ??? : h17
 jansteen 3d*: Let me give a choice: j16 or h17
 ironbird 3d : g16
 ironbird 3d : h17
 bj1 1k*: j17
 load 18k*: j16...
 jansteen 3d*: That's safe, ironbird :-\)]
;
W[id]
C[ jansteen 3d*: good!
 jansteen 3d*: The difference is being heavy or light
 jansteen 3d*: however, h17 is also possible]
;
B[kc]
C[ jansteen 3d*: next move is surpising to me, any ideas?
 up 2k : Next move on the right side? prettygirl ??? : b15
 maestro NR : l15?
 ironbird 3d : o17?
 jansteen 3d*: I could never play like that...
 water 4d : o3
 jansteen 3d*: It seems small to me :-\)
 Anybody 2k*: g16 ?
 jansteen 3d*: I will show it]
;
W[jq]
C[
 Anybody 2k*: whats so funny about that move ?! :-\)
 jansteen 3d*: It is a kind of double wing formation, but still :-\)
 water 4d : too far from my o3:\)
 jansteen 3d*: Well, in the usual case there is a shimari in the lower left
 jansteen 3d*: In this case there is thickness, that's quite different
 jansteen 3d*: Right, o3 would seem more usual to me as well
 jansteen 3d*: wider, because LL is solid
 bj1 1k*: w is waiting a long game
 jansteen 3d*: next move is predictable, where?
 bj1 1k*: q10?
 ironbird 3d : q10
 prettygirl ??? : a11
