 jansteen 3d*: Where does white play next?
 jansteen 3d*: Let me explain about the shape along the right
 jansteen 3d*: side White seeks efficiency along the right side
 jansteen 3d*: The point is that when white would simply play
 jansteen 3d*: joseki with q7 now, black could eventually play
 jansteen 3d*: the perfect move at r13.
]
;W[nc]C[
 jansteen 3d*: So white forces black to take a decision *before*
 jansteen 3d*: the right side shape is settled When black would
 jansteen 3d*: play r13 now, then white would choose the q6
 jansteen 3d*: joseki instead of the one starting with q7.
]
;B[qf]C[
 madmax 6k*: whenever I do this as white, b always q6.
 jansteen 3d*: q6 would be an option, white would play r14 and
 jansteen 3d*: take the initiative. By the way, don't fear q6 madmax,
 jansteen 3d*: it is not as big as it seems.
 mas 18k*: because b corner is already live?
 jansteen 3d*: Well, yes mas, that's also part of the reason.

 jansteen 3d*: Black l17 puts white under attack
 jansteen 3d*: What are white's options now?
 madmax 6k*: w can q17.
 jansteen 3d*: Right, madmax, q17 is normal. What's the other normal move?
 madmax 6k*: could r17
 jansteen 3d*: r17 is less attractive because l17 would become well placed
 madmax 6k*: q18 a option?
 jansteen 3d*: No, q18 would spoil r17
 jansteen 3d*: All these moves just defend, try to think positive :-)
 madmax 6k*: j17.
 jansteen 3d*: Right, madmax! But now reconsider the shape in upper left
 nbk 5k*: H17
 jansteen 3d*: Close, nbk
]
;W[gc]C[
 jansteen 3d*: This is the multi-purpose move: encloses the
 jansteen 3d*: corner and attacks l17. By attacking l17, o17
 jansteen 3d*: gains strength indirectly The fight is fair now,
 jansteen 3d*: because both sides have a weak group.
 mas 18k*: but g17 in fact does nothing to secure the corner.
 jansteen 3d*: Yes, it does mas, one more move (c16) and the corner is territory.
 jansteen 3d*: Next move p17, ironant?
 ironant 1d*: yes!
 jansteen 3d*: Other ideas here?
 nbk 5k*: p18.
 jansteen 3d*: p18 would allow o18 in sente, weakening the l17 stone.
 tromp 3k*:  q18
 jansteen 3d*: q18 is worth considering although unusual.
 ironant 1d*: p17
 jansteen 3d*: p17 is hard to play because after o16 the corner is still not 100% "clean"
 iowano9 5k*: q17
 nbk 5k*: q17
 jansteen 3d*: right, nbk and iowano9, you got it.
]
;B[pc]
;W[me]C[
 jansteen 3d*: jumping away lightly looks good.
 jansteen 3d*: Black now to move l17 stone, any ideas?
 ironant 1d*: l15 without hesitation
 jansteen 3d*: Right ironant, l15 pretty normal here.
 jansteen 3d*: But black decided to play leaning attack technique here
 nbk 5k*: j16.
]
;B[hd]C[
 nbk 5k*: I was close.
 jansteen 3d*: Right nbk, but h16 is better than j16 because white (almost) has to answer, j16 in comparison is soft.
 nbk 5k*: What would happen if w didn't answer?
 jansteen 3d*: Then black would establish a base with h17, nbk

 jansteen 3d*: Black thick now,
 jansteen 3d*: so the weakness at r8 is shining brightly here.
 weida NR : w p11
 jansteen 3d*: p11 next seems very natural.
 jansteen 3d*: White goes for territory instead with the next move.

 jansteen 3d*: Next move?
 zhangui NR : n5
 jansteen 3d*: n5 is interesting, flattening black while protecting n8.
 tigerman 1k*:  p11 possible?
 jansteen 3d*: p11 is great move as well, agree.
 jansteen 3d*: The other move which is huge is c15 in my opinion
]
;W[oi]
;B[nb]C[
 bongo 4d : p11 is not fast, w must be satisfied with his game.
 ironant 1d*: I think is such kind of move one plays when he leads. Does W lead now?
 jansteen 3d*: Hmm, ironant, p11 has to :-)
 jansteen 3d*: Why o18, anyone has opinion on this move?
 brokko 1k*: looks slow
 jansteen 3d*: right, looks slow
 bongo 4d : ic, after p11, p18 threatening n16 aji would be big.
 jansteen 3d*: right bongo! p18 in sente would be painful.
 jansteen 3d*: next move?
 madmax 6k*: c15
]
;W[ce]C[
 jansteen 3d*: right madmax
 jansteen 3d*: Preventing c17 makes opening very acceptable for white in my opinion.
 jansteen 3d*: Maybe black h16 didn't bring what black expected: white took both c15 and p11
 GeGe NR : is c10 a must now?
 jansteen 3d*: right GeGe, but why c10?
 GeGe NR : prevent w d10? :)
 jansteen 3d*: Sure! But I mean why exactly that point?
 madmax 6k*: c10 because makes c13 and c7 miai.
 jansteen 3d*: right madmax
 tigerman 1k*:  c15 is better than c15, my sensei told me.
 jansteen 3d*: Right, tigerman, when c10 instead of c15, black would immediately invade c17

;B[cg]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Now bongo's idea, where? :-)
 kyyi 2k*:  e8
 jansteen 3d*: e8 is too small.
 bongo 4d : Seems w doesn't need to try hard, n5
 jansteen 3d*: n5 is right direction, white played different shape though.
]
;W[lo]C[
 jansteen 3d*: if black answers with m3, what then?
 jansteen 3d*: (white's right side moyo is getting big)
]
;B[nl]C[
 tigerman 1k*:  o8 looks good
 bongo 4d : aha,
 jansteen 3d*: The idea of o8 is that when white answers with q9, black gained here
 mas 18k*: not too deep?
 jansteen 3d*: no mas, black can escape either by o10 or m8 (two-way exit)

 jansteen 3d*: s7 prevents s6

 tigerman 1k*:  I think b did, but I'm not sure.
 jansteen 3d*: This exchange is even, tigerman.
 jansteen 3d*: Partly, because white has sente.

 malf 4k : l13
 kyyi 2k*:  L13
 garm 15k : k10

 jansteen 3d*: c17 is a clever move.
 jansteen 3d*: When white answers c16, then black has lots of aji in the corner.
 jansteen 3d*: When white answers d17, black has b15 aji
 NUTS NR : b want to make c10 group safer.
 jansteen 3d*: Right NUTS, the c10 group is involved as well.

 NUTS NR : b may try c6 as well?
 jansteen 3d*: c6 is very brave :-)
 bj1 1k*:  now w leads?
 jansteen 3d*: no bj1, it's a completely open game so far.
 ironant 1d*: B has about 10 pts ahaed on board, but also one weak group. anyone else has a idea who leads?
 tigerman 1k*:  b has caught up some in territory, right jan?
 jansteen 3d*: The territory is fairly even as well I think.
 NUTS NR : if w b16, b sente
 NUTS NR : but not sure b14 can kill b
 jansteen 3d*: right NUTS

 tigerman 1k*:  I was! today must be my day :&)
 jansteen 3d*: Instead of s5 white should have played e2
 jansteen 3d*: White e2, black blocks, white hane and connection, and then s5
 jansteen 3d*: The difference is that when black plays d4, white can answer c6
 jansteen 3d*: At that stage white was slightly (one micron) ahead.
