 imp NR : no comment on r14 and r17?
 jansteen 3d*:  This is the position where Yasuda suggested another move for o16
 jansteen 3d*:  r14 usually r10
 jansteen 3d*:  r17 can not be halped, but o17 instead possible too
 jansteen 3d*:  heklped
 jansteen 3d*:  helped
 imp NR : ok
 jansteen 3d*:  sorry :)
 imp NR : what did we consider here...
 jansteen 3d*:  So, according to Yasuda only one move now
 jansteen 3d*:  We considered o16, n15 and p4 maybe?
 imp NR : we talked about d15, q5/p6, n15,
 imp NR : q5/p4 sorry
 jansteen 3d*:  Who suggested q5?
 imp NR : f5 exists
 imp NR : i did
 jansteen 3d*:  Very good imp, q5 is only move here!
 imp NR : or around k10
 imp NR : that's it, not?
 imp NR : so q5 here
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, q5 here
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, but now next question....

 jansteen 3d*:  This sequence is normal
 jansteen 3d*:  What now?
 imp NR : we hesitated about:
 jansteen 3d*:  You have a remarable memory imp :)
 jansteen 3d*:  remarkable
 imp NR : k15 (most votes), l14, k16,
 imp NR : and stein played p4, no?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right
 jansteen 3d*:  Yasuda suggested another move, and after seeing it, it's very logical
 imp NR : but p4 must be ok here!?
 jansteen 3d*:  no, it isn't
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi David!
 jansteen 3d*:  Do you have ideas in this position, sch?
 imp NR : hi:)
 jansteen 3d*:  club, any sugestions for white's next move?
 imp NR : q4 only other that i can think of
 imp NR : around m5 helps black on lower left, around q7 useless as far as i can see

;W[op]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This is the way to play for white
 jansteen 3d*:  For example.....

 jansteen 3d*:  Black suddenly very limited
 imp NR : agree, not good for b
 jansteen 3d*:  Hard to make up for the territorial loss at the top
 imp NR : well, not terrific:)
 jansteen 3d*:  This is the reason way black should play q5 instead of o16, o16 is too dangerous
 imp NR : and r8 instead of p4 not terrific either  i suppose:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, that's another option
 jansteen 3d*:  And now?
 imp NR : q4
 jansteen 3d*:  David?
 imp NR : hi:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi Caspar :)
 imp NR : new comments:)
 jansteen 3d*:  I asked commentary from Yasuda
 jansteen 3d*:  Q4 comes close
 jansteen 3d*:  denots?
 imp NR : p5 safer:)
 jansteen 3d*:  r3 is sharp
 imp NR : interesting:)
 jansteen 3d*:  For example....
 imp NR : must be good that
 jansteen 3d*:  This is well known joseki
 imp NR : funny, when asked we cannot find it
 imp NR : but once on the board one says: good:)

 jansteen 3d*:  This is softly played by black
 jansteen 3d*:  White territory everywhere, black only one
 jansteen 3d*:  Black will loose this way
 jansteen 3d*:  Not my comments club :)
 imp NR : well, b now o4, wo3, b o4, then w sente to reduce
 jansteen 3d*:  I'm just transmitting comments which I got from Yasuda, 8p
 imp NR : difficult to reduce well for us ama's:)
 jansteen 3d*:  imp, important to realize: doesn't matter from this position, white better
 imp NR : if correct folluw-up, jan:)
 jansteen 3d*:  right imp :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Right denots
 jansteen 3d*:  And instead of o16, black should have q5
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, nice to know :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, one more interesting comment....
 jansteen 3d*:  q6 only nmove
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's next move?
 imp NR : q7 instead better?
 jansteen 3d*:  q3 is an option
 jansteen 3d*:  q7 *much* too soft
 imp NR : or p5?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes imp!
 jansteen 3d*:  Black has a terrific wall at the top, so it's important to fight
 jansteen 3d*:  possible (likely) continuation

 imp NR : try q5 instead. i believe this is good for b jan:)
 jansteen 3d*:  This way black is not depending on one territory anymore
 jansteen 3d*:  Suddenly he has various territories
 jansteen 3d*:  And besides white still not fully alive
 imp NR : this is nice for b: transform w up in terr down. But now the diff stuff: no o5:)
 jansteen 3d*:  White q4, shall we see?
 imp NR : sure:)
 imp NR : too far jan
 jansteen 3d*:  This one denots?
 jansteen 3d*:  and now?
 imp NR : this is nothing (sorry Caspar) :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Black very thick, and p6 sad
 jansteen 3d*:  (Yasuda's comment)
 jansteen 3d*:  s5 important denots :)
 imp NR : too good for b: w only small corner, b walls shine now, + terr
 jansteen 3d*:  s5 is big, if white gets s5 then o5 cutting point becomes serious
 imp NR : if you let w s5, then b thin i think
 jansteen 3d*:  right
