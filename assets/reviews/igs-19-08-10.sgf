 imp NR : hi
 imp NR : rare bug dat:(
 imp NR : client of server?
 imp NR : :(
 imp NR : ok
 jansteen 3d*:  ok, done
 jansteen 3d*:  Welke procedure zullen we dit keer volgen?
 jansteen 3d*:  Wil je over elke zet nadenken?
 imp NR : kies zelf maar
 imp NR : mag, hoeft niet
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, dan vraag ik wel op geschikte momenten

 jansteen 3d*:  Good guys :)
 imp NR : p3 alt?

;W[qp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move is important
 imp NR : q10
 imp NR : btw, who is who, and what komi?
 jansteen 3d*:  White has considerable thickness in lower-left
 jansteen 3d*:  The title mentions the color, komi is 0
 jansteen 3d*:  Do you have the title imp?
 imp NR : can't see title, remember:(
 jansteen 3d*:  Oh, right, sorry, Guo Juan is black with no komi
 imp NR : thx, is what i thought
 jansteen 3d*:  Considering white's thickness on the board, q10 is loose
 jansteen 3d*:  As you will see from black's moves in the opening, the thickness affects b's choices
 jansteen 3d*:  Anyway, next black's move is only for both players
 imp NR : alt that i see: q7,k16, o3
 jansteen 3d*:  Good imp, it's there
 jansteen 3d*:  Which one?
 imp NR : :)
 imp NR : q10:)
 imp NR : is it o3?
]
;B[nq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  yes, o3 important now, otherwise bottom becomes hard to handle
 imp NR : did they analyse afterwards?
 jansteen 3d*:  o3 is fine, miai of r3 and l3
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, only the important moments
 jansteen 3d*:  This moment is important, what's b's next move?
 imp NR : if you have that, please tell their ideas and remarks, ok?
 jansteen 3d*:  Sure, that's what I'll do when I remember them
 imp NR : but no comment here, too evident?
 jansteen 3d*:  o3 you mean?
 imp NR : yes
 jansteen 3d*:  o3 is locally best, better than o4 or p4
 jansteen 3d*:  o4 is harder to settle, p4 would allow a sever pincer
 imp NR : ok
 jansteen 3d*:  White's move now?
 jansteen 3d*:  (important moment)
 jansteen 3d*:  Choices?
 imp NR : again? :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, o3 was important, next white move even more!
 imp NR : m3 or q3
 jansteen 3d*:  One more
 imp NR : p4 not good here i thought at first:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, p4
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, three choices, which is best? :)
 jansteen 3d*:  agree fremont
 jansteen 3d*:  m3 below q3
 jansteen 3d*:  And where do we put p4?
 imp NR : p4 is interesting, but i first thought r3
 imp NR : so r3 no 1 for me
 jansteen 3d*:  q3 you mean, right?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, p4, then q2, and next?
 imp NR : yea, q3 sorry
 imp NR : alt is m4
 jansteen 3d*:  Hmm, fremont, you'll need a pincer first
 jansteen 3d*:  I will show what they thought was best for white here

;W[qf]C[
 imp NR : well, p3 also jos

;B[nc]
;W[pj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This is best for white, black still weak, and white gaining thickness and territory
 jansteen 3d*:  For example...

;B[ir]
;W[mp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black not happy
 imp NR : go on...
 jansteen 3d*:  There are at least 10 variations instead of this one, but maybe Yasuda can show them again Saturday Henk
 imp NR : ok:)
 imp NR : how is your board? :)
 imp NR : one more
 jansteen 3d*:  My board doesn't reflect the undo's as last time
 imp NR : oh jee
 imp NR : hier ok nu
 jansteen 3d*:  I'm ok, have a new board now
 imp NR : cong:)
 jansteen 3d*:  The game...
 imp NR : wow, my error:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move? Want to guess direction here?
 imp NR : L, R, or U, that's the q:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Right
 imp NR : hm, nothing really promising for b
 imp NR : around k16 for me
 jansteen 3d*:  Any other suggestions?
 imp NR : r14
 jansteen 3d*:  Pretty normal development
 jansteen 3d*:  Very good fremont, why?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, o5 prevents a white attack there
 jansteen 3d*:  It also aims at q5, r5, q7, to split up right side
 jansteen 3d*:  o5 is much better shape anderson
 jansteen 3d*:  We will soon see why
 imp NR : q6 now?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right imp
 imp NR : right fremond:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next black move?
 imp NR : right fremont, sorry
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, q7 better shape than q6 (which is a bit tight)
 imp NR : r12, or too early?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yasuda praised black's next move after the game
 imp NR : or do something on L
 jansteen 3d*:  r12 seems a bit unbalanced considering black is doing ok in territory
 jansteen 3d*:  k16 might be ok, not sure
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, that's my feeling too with k16
 imp NR : c9 something?
 jansteen 3d*:  Black is not in the position to start building a moyo
 jansteen 3d*:  k5 is right idea (strengthening bottom group)
 jansteen 3d*:  k5 doesn't affect white's left side position much though
 jansteen 3d*:  right fremont
 imp NR : simply j3?
 jansteen 3d*:  EVen more simple :)
 imp NR : is this better than j3?
 jansteen 3d*:  This move is big
 jansteen 3d*:  How do you evaluate j3/h3 exchange, imp?
 wrferrer 10k*:  one question, would g3 instead of j2 had been a bad move?
 imp NR : then j2
 wrferrer 10k*:  can you explain please fremont?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right now g3 would be too soon wrferrer, but after j2 black has g3 to aim for
 wrferrer 10k*:  ok thx for the explanations
 jansteen 3d*:  If g3 instead of j2, white would g2 and black's shape is destroyed
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi mars :)
 jansteen 3d*:  3d* again? :)
]
;B[mq]
;W[fc]
;B[po]
;W[qo]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This shows why o5 better than p5, anderson, black's shape very good now
 jansteen 3d*:  Good point mars :)
 jansteen 3d*:  That might be hard, agree :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, back to the game
 jansteen 3d*:  Any suggestions for black's strategy in UL?
 jansteen 3d*:  Not for the moment, anderson, byt when gets extra stones at outside: yes
 imp NR : c14 for me
 jansteen 3d*:  Black chose simple variation, often seen in pro game
 imp NR : why not fremont?
 jansteen 3d*:  c14 I also don't like much
 imp NR : pls explain
 jansteen 3d*:  c14 doesn't look efficient with c6 stone also along left side
 imp NR : so e18?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right again fremont
]
;B[fd]
;W[gd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  And?
]
;B[ec]C[
 imp NR : yes
]
;W[fe]
;B[ed]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This is a good choice of joseki
 jansteen 3d*:  Black gets a nice corner while white is not particularly interested in top
 jansteen 3d*:  Both players agreed that black is better here
 jansteen 3d*:  right again, fremont :)
]
;W[fb]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's next move shows Guo Juan's spirit for the game
 imp NR : f18 only now, no?
 jansteen 3d*:  So strategically you're strong, but tactically a bit weak?
 T3 1d*: who are the players ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Check title pls, T3
 T3 1d*: I only saw jansteen - jansteen, jansteen
 jansteen 3d*:  Yasuda Yasutoshi, 8p (w) vs Guo Juan, 5p (b)
]
;B[id]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Right club, you know Guo Juan?
 T3 1d*: thx, jansteen
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, g15 is usual answer to j16
 T3 1d*: is Guo Juan female player?
 jansteen 3d*:  g15 now aims at c16 aji
 jansteen 3d*:  So usually black would protect (against c16) with d14
 jansteen 3d*:  After that it depends on the game what to play next
 jansteen 3d*:  Wait a little bit, fremont, the game flows naturally....
]
;W[eb]
;B[cc]
;W[ge]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's c17 helps against c16 so now black can jump farther
]
;B[dg]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move for white?
 jansteen 3d*:  j17 is pretty normal, to settle quickly
 jansteen 3d*:  l17 is right spirit but wrong shape
 jansteen 3d*:  right fremont
]
;W[kd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  l16's immediately treat is j15 cover
 jansteen 3d*:  White h18 club?
 jansteen 3d*:  Of course black has to prevent j16 cover now, how?
 jansteen 3d*:  right club
 imp NR : k16
 jansteen 3d*:  Funny
 jansteen 3d*:  This was one of the few moments where Guo Juan thought really long
 jansteen 3d*:  k16 is very hard to play for a professional
 T3 1d*: looks B don't have good move here,
 imp NR : k16 is not one you like to play:)
 jansteen 3d*:  It's a very bad style move
 T3 1d*: guess B will move somewhere else
 jansteen 3d*:  Right imp, k16 bumps your head against a wall
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi Don :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Locally, black's peep is at h18, donw
 jansteen 3d*:  h17 is sente peep but doesn't look good either, agree :)
 jansteen 3d*:  So....
]
;B[jd]C[
 T3 1d*: oops
 jansteen 3d*:  k16 splits perfectly for the time being while having h18 peep as a bonus
 jansteen 3d*:  Still, Guo Juan didn't want to discuss k16 after the game, she felt not good about it :)
]
;W[ke]
;B[if]
;W[fh]
;B[jg]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next white move?
 T3 1d*: if that is the case, then j16 no good
 jansteen 3d*:  Not necessarily T3, but reading perfect sequence might take a lot of study
 jansteen 3d*:  One more chance for next move, think professionally: multi-purpose
 imp NR : i want around p5
 jansteen 3d*:  p5? :)
 imp NR : p15 sorry
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, yes!

 imp NR : big that
]
;W[mg]C[
 imp NR : m12 i mean
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move for black?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, m12 important
 T3 1d*: N12?
 jansteen 3d*:  n12 is kikashi
 jansteen 3d*:  It's black's priviledge
 T3 1d*: what is kikashi?
 jansteen 3d*:  kikashi is forcing move
 T3 1d*: then kikashi
 jansteen 3d*:  black n12, white o12, black o11, white p12 is black's priviledge
 jansteen 3d*:  Interesting to see opinions about direction here :)
 imp NR : this i never know: stay away from moves like p11 and take d11 letting w get o11 or n12, or first reduce
 T3 1d*: B should make M12 group stronger before attack
 jansteen 3d*:  g10 and f10 are very enthusiastic!
 T3 1d*: N12 ok
 jansteen 3d*:  g10 is the game
 jansteen 3d*:  g10 was characterised after the game by Guo Juan as amateurish
 T3 1d*: geese, I have to go now, who won this game?
 jansteen 3d*:  I won't tell you T3
 jansteen 3d*:  :)
 jansteen 3d*:  h10 is indeed the best move here
 T3 1d*: have fun guys
 imp NR : get the game recoord later by mail T3:)
 T3 1d*: I am gonna see this move before i go
 jansteen 3d*:  Solid, strong, keeping the attack alive, neutralising bottom thickness....
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, club, h10 was 100 percent move here
]
;B[gj]C[
 T3 1d*: N12 strengthen B
 imp NR : not possible d11 inducing it?
 jansteen 3d*:  Of course, black played g10 because of promising e11 follow-up and g3 aji options
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, back, sorry :)
 evan 3k*: hi all
 imp NR : what about b d11 trying to induce h10?
 jansteen 3d*:  Client and window manager problems, things mortals don't want to hear about :)
 imp NR : hi:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Guo Juan of course choose g10 since it has a nice e11 follow-up and also g3 is still there
 jansteen 3d*:  That's right, donw forced me to play a lot of Go! :)
 jansteen 3d*:  It is :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move *nobody* will guess, bet? :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Is it a nice shirt club? :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move is "cool"
 jansteen 3d*:  haha, club :)
 jansteen 3d*:  I wait...
 imp NR : there is still g3, but now??
 jansteen 3d*:  c13 neat, agree :)
 jansteen 3d*:  ok, shall I give it away?
]
;W[ij]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Isn't this cool? :)
 jansteen 3d*:  j10 destroys black's shape and also aims at k11 (kikashi) and whole group attack
 jansteen 3d*:  Scary move indeed
 jansteen 3d*:  Thanks for participating fremont!
]
;B[hb]C[
 imp NR : bye fremont,
 jansteen 3d*:  Thanks
 jansteen 3d*:  Black playing h18 now is logical

 wrferrer 10k*:  black's center moyo is becoming really impressive!!
