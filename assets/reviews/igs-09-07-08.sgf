;B[pd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This is the fifth game of the best of seven
 jansteen 3d*:  The score at this point: 3-1 for Cho Chikun (taking white in this game)
 jansteen 3d*:  Before the match Cho announced: "I made a mistake last year by loosing the title to Kobayashi"
 jansteen 3d*:  Then he made another mistake by loosing the first game of this match as well
 jansteen 3d*:  But then he regained himself and won three in a row, making it 3-1

;W[dd]
;B[qp]
;W[dp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Cho playing ni-hoshi, is seen more frequently these days
 jansteen 3d*:  Black has many options in this position, but the most frequently played are p3 and f3
]
;B[fq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Right sia
]
;W[dn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This gaem was played the 6th and 7th of March, last week that is
 jansteen 3d*:  The idea of black f3 is to play "small chinese"
]
;B[kq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black l3 makes it unattractive for white to invade p3/p4
 jansteen 3d*:  So black is likely to get a framework along the bottom
 jansteen 3d*:  White's next move is natural, where?
 nomad 5d*:  r10 only
 jansteen 3d*:  In the opening it's often enough to take a careful look at the whole picture
 jansteen 3d*:  If black could play q10 in this position he would be quite happy
 jansteen 3d*:  Right nutpick
]
;W[qj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This white move splits up the right side and makes the lower side suddenly look "flat"
 jansteen 3d*:  A good and normal move
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, now black: where is big now?
 jansteen 3d*:  r12 and r8 are miai (either player gets one of them) so traditionally it's not urgent to play there right now
 nomad 5d*:  r12 normal move
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi Tom, sure r12 is not a bad move at all
 nomad 5d*:  r12 is shuko's move :-)
 khc 1k*: p4
 jansteen 3d*:  Black choose similar strategy as white: splitting the major white area
 ManyOopses 8k :  ' c10?
 jansteen 3d*:  The bird is right :)
]
;B[ci]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  With nomad there I should leave him some bandwidth for comments :)
 jansteen 3d*:  pls try to think about the moves, don't copy them from the game record :)
 jansteen 3d*:  The next move I can't understand, too high level for me
 jansteen 3d*:  It seems as if it's not part of the previous flow of the game
 nomad 5d*:  many possibilities now
 nomad 5d*:  q7, o17...
 jansteen 3d*:  yaowei, we're analysing the game, can't go quicker :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Pls, anyone, ideas for next?
 nomad 5d*:  q7
 ZZTOP 1d*: all move on the right are miai, on the left , too. So only K17 stays :)
 jansteen 3d*:  p5 is not the move played, dahui
]
;W[hq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  nomad, ever seen this move before in similar circumstances?
 nomad 5d*:  no :-)
 jansteen 3d*:  dahui, why should I?
 nomad 5d*:  to invade lower side, j3 more usual than h3
 jansteen 3d*:  j3 because of follow-up at n3 nomad?
 nomad 5d*:  usually the idea to attack is not to get too close...
 jansteen 3d*:  Black choose to ignore this move
 jansteen 3d*:  The h3 attack not really serious because black can still take (3,3) , d3, f5, ...
]
;B[cf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black decides to move away from the lower-side battgle field with this move
 jansteen 3d*:  he reasons: black f3 can take care of itself
 ZZTOP 1d*: I see no battle field :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Also, h3 doesn't affect the lower-right too much
]
;W[fc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  At this point black decided to turn the lower-right corner into territory
]
;B[qh]
;W[pm]
;B[op]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black r12 induced q7 which induced p4
 ManyOopses 8k :  yes why q7?
 jansteen 3d*:  q7 is a nice light shape
 nomad 5d*:  if r7, B would q6
 jansteen 3d*:  White now applies the same technique as black just now, turning lower-left into territory
]
;W[ce]
;B[df]
;W[ck]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Of course this territory is not 100% because of the weakness at (3,3)
 jansteen 3d*:  So, what's next?
 ManyOopses 8k :  upper side?
 nomad 5d*:  r8?
 jansteen 3d*:  The move played is amongst these suggestions
 ManyOopses 8k :  l17
 NS 3k : n17
 jansteen 3d*:  l17 is not so big because upper-right would be thin
]
;B[cq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black choose the territory move
 jansteen 3d*:  The next moves are a standard sequence in this position
]
;W[dq]
;B[dr]
;W[cp]
;B[br]
;W[bq]
;B[cr]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White's next move again seems unusual to me
 ManyOopses 8k :  g5?
 NS 3k : around f15, maybe
 jansteen 3d*:  Locally maybe f4, ManyOopses
]
;W[fe]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Good NS!
 jansteen 3d*:  nomad, does this move affect the corner aji?
 nomad 5d*:  if W played f17 at f16, he can now d12...
 NS 3k : thx,  f15 a thick move often seen in handycap game :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move makes sense, black's left side group is not really weak
 jansteen 3d*:  So if tenuki, where?
 jansteen 3d*:  No, again l17 would be too thin for upper-right
 NS 3k : o17 big now for w
 jansteen 3d*:  Although the move black played also looks thin :)
]
;B[mc]C[
 nomad 5d*:  also unusual
 jansteen 3d*:  This move slightly protects the corner while preventing white from building the top with a move around here
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, for me o17 also more usual, maestro
 jansteen 3d*:  White's next, where?
 jansteen 3d*:  (white doesn't attack the left-side group)
 nomad 5d*:  r17
 ManyOopses 8k :  r17?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, r17!

 NS 3k : wo! live?

;B[re]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 NS 3k : is s17 live?
 jansteen 3d*:  nomad, what's wrong with s17 here?
 NS 3k : s16 will be a big ko though
]
;W[rb]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This ko seems unnecessary for whitwe
 jansteen 3d*:  No maestro, r15 cut works I think
 jansteen 3d*:  Hard not to hear you dahui :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Maybe black gets thick, but white knows that when invading a corner
]
;B[sd]
;W[sc]
;B[rc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Anyone idea for white's ko threat?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, bj2, white probably sente when s18-->s17

 ManyOopses 8k :  don't think r6 possible for w
 jansteen 3d*:  Can white r6 now?
 ManyOopses 8k :  r6 s2
 jansteen 3d*:  Too early for comments psi, maybe next week
 ManyOopses 8k :  w p3 maybe?
]
;W[oq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Please analyse r6 with a board to check variations
]
;B[pn]
;W[oo]
;B[on]
;W[np]
;B[qm]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White got strong along the bottom, black along the right side + upper-right
 ManyOopses 8k :  no lowerside mojo for b now
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move?
 jansteen 3d*:  Good, o6 indeed a must-move
]
;W[nn]
;B[om]
;W[nm]
;B[ol]
;W[mk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White flattens right side while building up own side
 jansteen 3d*:  Kobayashi Satoru showed it various times in this Kisei match:
 jansteen 3d*:  Too big territories get invaded by him...

;W[hp]
;B[ho]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  godiva, consider the number of invested stones
 ManyOopses 8k :  i agree with girl
 ManyOopses 8k :  h5 looks safer
 jansteen 3d*:  No, I don't agree :) Imagine black turns at o8, too big!
]
;W[iq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  No p10 with black at o8
]
;B[jp]
;W[fp]C[
 ManyOopses 8k :  b i understand w is a mistery
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's next move is of pro standard, solid and quiet
]
;B[in]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Somehow the game looks difficult for white now I feel, but o7 or n9 is not to blame
 ManyOopses 8k :  b4 sente
]
;W[fr]
;B[bp]
;W[bo]
;B[aq]
;W[il]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move implies a double-attack, also upper-left group is weakened

;B[ff]
;W[gf]
;B[fg]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Right psi, I don't particularly like white h3
]
;W[oj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White's big follow-up of n9
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, f15 is also unusual for me, but not sure
