 jansteen 3d*:  black can give the komi :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Waiting for imp to be back
 imp NR : hoi
 imp NR : hi malf
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi shouzhuo, it's a lightning game for the Tokyo Cup
 jansteen 3d*:  hi all, shall we start?
 jansteen 3d*:  I didn't replay this game before so I will be as suprised as you are
 jansteen 3d*:  No shouzhuo, but there was a message on rec.games.go just now
 imp NR : hi everyone:)

 jansteen 3d*:  Well, they "go there own way"
 jansteen 3d*:  their
 jansteen 3d*:  Difficult position
 jansteen 3d*:  :)
 jansteen 3d*:  What's direction in lower-right?
 jansteen 3d*:  right malf, question is: r4 or r8?
 jansteen 3d*:  Why malf?
 imp NR : r8 (Kirsten), same for me:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Why?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, r8 has two meanings: attack r6 and develop q16
]
;B[ql]C[
 imp NR : otherwise low on lower side?
]
;W[qf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  We all are, club :)
 jansteen 3d*:  That's why we study pro game together :)
]
;B[nc]
;W[rd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move makes sense, ideas?
 jansteen 3d*:  (previous moves make sense too, but next move can be predicted)
 jansteen 3d*:  o17 was played with a purpose
 imp NR : so, black plays f15:)
 jansteen 3d*:  What's the hottest place on the board?
 jansteen 3d*:  right imp!
 jansteen 3d*:  Difference between white f16 or black f15 is huge
 jansteen 3d*:  (fundamentals of Go: connecting and cutting)
]
;B[fe]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move makes d14 and j16 miai
 imp NR : thx club, but my daughter Kisten is helping me:)
]
;W[cf]C[
 imp NR : Kirsten, sorry
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 jansteen 3d*:  Did you pay attention :)
 imp NR : we say j16
 jansteen 3d*:  imp and Kirsten payed attention :)
]
;B[id]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Just checking, malf :)
 jansteen 3d*:  And now two choices: j17 or e17, which one?
 jansteen 3d*:  Why?
 imp NR : agree here
 jansteen 3d*:  Right malf, walking along the top is bad because o17 is waiting
]
;W[ec]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Anyone knows next move for black?
 jansteen 3d*:  right club
]
;B[ic]
;W[fb]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This trade is fair since white protected the upper-left corner with e17 and f18
 jansteen 3d*:  The usual move for black is g17 here, but there is another hot area, anyone can spot it?
 imp NR : r12?
 jansteen 3d*:  r12 is not so urgent
 jansteen 3d*:  White's upper-right can settle by either r17 or r11, so not urgent
 imp NR : hmm, in LR then
 jansteen 3d*:  club got it
 imp NR : but nothing special there?
 jansteen 3d*:  White played elsewhere after r8, r4 collects interest
]
;B[qp]C[
 imp NR : ah, did not think r4 was *that* important:) Good club!
 Pollux 11k :  ;hi. all dans here?
 imp NR : guess not, normally many strengths participate:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move also makes sense, remember what I said about UL joseki?
 imp NR : so welcome to join in
 jansteen 3d*:  Think more severe malf
 jansteen 3d*:  You got the idea, just perfection now
]
;W[hd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White takes interest from black's tenuki
 imp NR : club in top-form:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move is must...
 jansteen 3d*:  which?
]
;B[he]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Right club, h15 only move
 jansteen 3d*:  Just a matter of shape, you don't need to read such a move
 imp NR : or j15:)
]
;W[hb]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Not j15 imp, h15 would slice through black's position
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move is also basic
 jansteen 3d*:  Which?
 imp NR : j15
 jansteen 3d*:  Right club
]
;B[ie]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Go is very simple game, just shape, cutting and connecting
 jansteen 3d*:  Everybody can play like this
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, nice momemnt to play elsewhere, where?
 jansteen 3d*:  l3, club?
 jansteen 3d*:  Why?
 imp NR : that would be to keep r6 somewhat alive
 jansteen 3d*:  all good reasons
 jansteen 3d*:  l3 protects h3, when black enters anyway white can still o3
]
;W[kq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Usually l3 is miai with another move
 jansteen 3d*:  Otherwise white's shape would become too perfect
 jansteen 3d*:  Which move?
 imp NR : c3 must, then w o3
 jansteen 3d*:  Good imp!
]
;B[cq]
;W[nq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  I would block at d3 instead of o3
 jansteen 3d*:  Would d3 be possible as well?
 imp NR : o3 gives b difficulties in the corner, keeps it slightly weak
 imp NR : sure malf
 jansteen 3d*:  ok
 jansteen 3d*:  Black has to move out of the corner now
 jansteen 3d*:  again: cutting (r6 and o3
 jansteen 3d*:  )
 imp NR : b has to do something in LR, which proves o3 better than d3:)
 jansteen 3d*:  There is a traditional combination here, which one?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right club, you are good interpreting hints :)
 imp NR : agree
]
;B[lp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  The combination is: m4, m3, o4
 imp NR : but it has!
 imp NR : so o5 or so now?
]
;W[mr]
;B[np]C[
 imp NR : p4 now?
]
;W[kp]
;B[oq]
;W[lo]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  The usual pro-magic playing with shapes and such this
 jansteen 3d*:  Both go their own way
 jansteen 3d*:  direction is correct club, shape?
 imp NR : f2 now?
 imp NR : or q7 defence?
 jansteen 3d*:  Game was played this year
]
;B[mn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  n6 goes ahead of white
 imp NR : better than q7 this:)
 jansteen 3d*:  White of course wants to use r6 most efficient way, but preparation is necessary, next?
 imp NR : r17?
 jansteen 3d*:  r10 very direct (leaves weakness at r12)
 jansteen 3d*:  r17 is big, but urgent move before big one
 imp NR : or d3?
 jansteen 3d*:  d3 only one purpose: defending territory
]
;W[ph]C[
 imp NR : still like r17 to pre-empt b r12
 jansteen 3d*:  This move radiates power all over the place
 jansteen 3d*:  Suddenly white q7 becomes an option, or l17 as well
 jansteen 3d*:  Besides, when black plays first at right side (r12), LR becomes very large and...
 imp NR : I think I understand this: has to do something against b r12, this better than corner
 jansteen 3d*:  r6 is eaten the largest possible way
 jansteen 3d*:  Black defends against q7, how?
 imp NR : q10?
 jansteen 3d*:  q10 correct idea but no follow-up move against white's position
]
;B[qj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Good :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next one logical as well, imp?
 jansteen 3d*:  r11 would be defense only
 imp NR : p10, or maybe q9?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, club!
]
;W[qc]C[
 imp NR : should have known:)
 jansteen 3d*:  r17 is: 1. big, 2. defense 3. attack
 imp NR : jans hints are strong:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Well, of course black doesn't defend with q17 here but seeks own ways, where?
 jansteen 3d*:  q17 would be similar to d3 kind of move: one purpose
 jansteen 3d*:  Don't think about local situation too much, fly around :)
 jansteen 3d*:  left side is least interesting area, both low: c6 and c14
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, club, amazing :)
]
;B[fr]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move is: 1. big 2. attacking potential
 imp NR : it's his day:)
 jansteen 3d*:  As you might understand by now white does not defend with something like g3 but also goes own way, where?
 imp NR : m17 maybe?
 jansteen 3d*:  p18 is not severe enough, direction is correct
 jansteen 3d*:  m17/l17 are equal direction, both correct, l17 more correct
 imp NR : simply q17?
]
;W[kc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This is shape because of j18 option
 jansteen 3d*:  Go can be very simple game
 jansteen 3d*:  This game is extremely simple and instructive I think
 imp NR : l16?
 jansteen 3d*:  Nothing special so far, all basic ideas
 jansteen 3d*:  What's difficult for us is to go our own way I think
 jansteen 3d*:  We see the points, but timing and such is difficult
 imp NR : true:)
 imp NR : j18 overplay here?
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, black is risking to be cut in two by l15, so?
 jansteen 3d*:  j18 definitely overplay, white l15
 jansteen 3d*:  m16 correct direction, black played lighter
]
;B[le]C[
 imp NR : but what if n16 now?
 jansteen 3d*:  If white n15 black will start fighting with q14 or similar
 imp NR : couldn't think of good answer
 jansteen 3d*:  With j18 still there this is an equal fight
 jansteen 3d*:  Think again club (shape)
]
;W[jb]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Why k18 club?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, less forcing moves for black now
]
;B[pf]
;W[pg]
;B[of]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black takes care of n16 weakness
]
;W[nh]
;B[qe]
;W[re]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  I go a bit quick here
 jansteen 3d*:  sorry
 jansteen 3d*:  White o12 quite a decision
 jansteen 3d*:  o12 valuable and still aiming thinness in black's top
 jansteen 3d*:  However, black can now ....
 jansteen 3d*:  ?
 imp NR : CUT:)
]
;B[qg]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Right on!
]
;W[rf]
;B[qh]
;W[pi]
;B[qi]C[
 imp NR : CONNECT now:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move: o9 or m12?
 jansteen 3d*:  Good feeling
]
;W[nk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  o9 prevents black o10 (which attacks and is very big)
 jansteen 3d*:  Lightning game, iiii, pls check the title
 jansteen 3d*:  How will black defend here?
 jansteen 3d*:  What does white want?
 jansteen 3d*:  back in a minute....
 imp NR : cliff hanger:)
 jansteen 3d*:  p8 would be usual way to defend, agree
 jansteen 3d*:  But then o9 would feel very much kikashi and white would take other keypoint (m12) as well
 jansteen 3d*:  Good spirit inkarri
 jansteen 3d*:  Go is simpler than moves like n11
 imp NR : simply m12?
]
;B[lh]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Right club :)
 jansteen 3d*:  And imp :)
 imp NR : jan only has to say "simple" and we all guess:)
 jansteen 3d*:  and malf :)
 jansteen 3d*:  I'm replaying it, inkarri :)
 jansteen 3d*:  m12 defends by attacking the white group
 jansteen 3d*:  pro's always look for positive solutions (with multiple meaning)
 jansteen 3d*:  m12 strengthens top and weakens white's group
 jansteen 3d*:  Now fighting comes as you might guess...
 jansteen 3d*:  thousand variations here, I just show the game....
]
;W[mo]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  n5 wants o6 obviously
]
;B[no]
;W[om]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Looks like black demolished here
 jansteen 3d*:  But just stay cool and....
]
;B[ok]C[
 imp NR : connect? :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Now miai of o8 and o10
 jansteen 3d*:  Counter-attack
]
;W[nl]
;B[ol]
;W[nn]
;B[nj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Result: white cut off n6, black captured q11: a furikawari

;W[mj]
;B[mi]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Who's better then inkarri?
 jansteen 3d*:  you think b better, club think w better; who's right? :)
]
;W[lj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White built thickness and saved r6 stone, I think at least equal for white
]
;B[pb]C[
 imp NR : anyway noway bad for white'
 jansteen 3d*:  this move is kikashi
]
;W[pc]
;B[oc]
;W[qb]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  all good points, club and malf
 jansteen 3d*:  Next sequence is interesting

]
;W[nm]
;B[kn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Suddenly tables seem turned, next move?
 jansteen 3d*:  Think possitive
 jansteen 3d*:  positive
 imp NR : m8?
 jansteen 3d*:  m8 correct direction
 jansteen 3d*:  m8 stresses defense
 jansteen 3d*:  look for offense :)

 pizza 1d : m6

 jansteen 3d*:  spectacular
 jansteen 3d*:  very close imp!
 hwong 10k*: jansteen, you make the game very interesting to watch!
 jansteen 3d*:  thank you hwong :)
 imp NR : l13?
 jansteen 3d*:  Try to combine the l17 stone and o11 cut
 imp NR : m14 also something to think of...
 jansteen 3d*:  yes imp!
]
;W[lf]C[
 imp NR : unfair, they have hours:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Not hours imp, this is lightning game :)
 imp NR : except in this game of course:)
