 Leon 1d*: i said h17 long time ago
 YC 3k*: w has two preempty corners.
 joachim 2k*:  as I said :-)

 Leon 1d*: that' ok :)
 Tesuji 4d : When I type "game title 32" it says game not found

 bj1 1d*: m15 slow
 ohboy 2d : n14?
 jansteen 3d*: Disadvantage of m15 is that's slow

 Leon 1d*: f17 :)
 lanlan 1d*: what is kikashi?
 joachim 2k*:  h15
 Tesuji 4d : h15
 jansteen 3d*: kikashi = "forcing move"
