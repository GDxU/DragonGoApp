 feanor 12k*: rd.  you can NOT afford to be passive when you're white on a 9x9... already at move 5 in the game, it was going to be difficult for you

 jansteen 3d*:  Sorry feanor? :)
 colombe 2d*: hi

 jansteen 3d*:  This is an exciting game, too difficult for us, but let's replay it anyway :)

 jansteen 3d*:  Hi Dimas
 jansteen 3d*:  What's shape now?
 colombe 2d*: r14 of course
 jansteen 3d*:  Other suggestions?
 jansteen 3d*:  r14 was not played
 jansteen 3d*:  Local shape, Dimas
 iplr 17k :  q13
 jansteen 3d*:  No, q13 is too loose, r14 locally is the best
 jansteen 3d*:  p13 is also too loose
 jansteen 3d*:  But there is another move :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Very logical
 iplr 17k :  o16?
 colombe 2d*: i dunno, teach me :)
 jansteen 3d*:  yes!
]
;B[nd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move turns the black stones into thickness
 jansteen 3d*:  If black r14, white will make the wall look funny with o18, peep, tobi
 jansteen 3d*:  This o16 move is easily missed
 jansteen 3d*:  Most players would play r14
]

;B[pf]
;W[qn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Where, Dimas?
 jansteen 3d*:  I mean where does it look overconcentrated?
 jansteen 3d*:  Oh, I see :) Remove both o16 and o17 and black looks perfect

;W[rn]
;B[qo]
;W[on]C[
 colombe 2d*: black is strons with k3
 colombe 2d*: so he can play s5
 jansteen 3d*:  Black s5 induces white q9 which induces q12
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, colombe is right, k3 is prerequisite for s5
]
;B[no]
;W[nn]
;B[mo]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White choose sente sequence for next move, which one?
 colombe 2d*: right side not important because of r13
 jansteen 3d*:  r8 is not interesting
 jansteen 3d*:  Right colombe, thanks
 jansteen 3d*:  k16 is right direction
 jansteen 3d*:  But k16 leaves a wide gap for black to enter
 jansteen 3d*:  j17 is already slightly better (gap is smaller)
 jansteen 3d*:  g17 still better, but doesn't defend the corner very well
 colombe 2d*: f17 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, f17 is the normal move here
]
;W[fc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  dimas, about your question: the o6/n5 exchange makes white much stronger
 jansteen 3d*:  White not too unhappy since k3-n5 relation is not perfect
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move for black? (where is big now)
 colombe 2d*: wari...
 imp NR : hi all:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Right colombe, any preferences
 yaowin 3k*:  c8?
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi imp! Just in time
 c24 4k*:  c11?
 jansteen 3d*:  c8 is interesting when black's bottom is strong (k3 at j4)
 hmy 1k : next move, left side
 imp NR : c11?
 jansteen 3d*:  j17 is small, too close to the black wall
 jansteen 3d*:  At the top the only black move to consider is h17 (all the way)
 jansteen 3d*:  c11 is the traditional wariuchi, good imp
 hmy 1k : c8 or c11
 imp NR : i was not alone ...
 jansteen 3d*:  c11 is natural since black can next extend two points either way
 jansteen 3d*:  It's a safe move
 jansteen 3d*:  (sorry, missed other c11 then)
 colombe 2d*: bur here the pros won't play it
]
;B[cj]C[
 c24 4k*:  why c10 is better than c11?
 imp NR : good question:)
 jansteen 3d*:  c24, then we have to look into the mind of the black player
 imp NR : aiming for b6?
 jansteen 3d*:  There is no direct reason, only circumstancial ones
 c24 4k*:  w c12 now?
 jansteen 3d*:  When black plays c11 which c9 is quite nice
 jansteen 3d*:  Now white c8 feels cramped
 jansteen 3d*:  Maybe that's why black choose for c10
 jansteen 3d*:  On the other hand, when now white c12 black can not make a two-space extension
 imp NR : guess it is also taste
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, this move is mostly matter of taste, and mood
 jansteen 3d*:  From now on the game develops into a fioghting game
 c24 4k*:  is W c12 nature move?
 jansteen 3d*:  The game is quite complex, so I replay for entertainment only
 jansteen 3d*:  No need to analyse, too difficut anyway :)
]
;W[hq]
;B[fo]
;W[dr]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Since white c8 was cramped white settles for this move
 jansteen 3d*:  Follow-up is f2

;B[fm]
;W[cl]C[
 colombe 2d*: o and ryu
 jansteen 3d*:  I don't like this c8 move, it's slow and gote
]
;B[hc]
;W[ce]C[
 imp NR : but its big:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Now black wants to cover around e9, what to play?
 imp NR : b8?
 iplr 17k :  O Rissei-Ryu Shikun, 22nd Meijin league (from game label)
 jansteen 3d*:  no tmartin, not 100 percent secure
 jansteen 3d*:  Good imp!
]
;B[bl]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  b8 is tesuji
 colombe 2d*: d8 next
 jansteen 3d*:  When white b9, then black gets moves from the outside naturally
 jansteen 3d*:  When white b7, black d8 is sente
 jansteen 3d*:  When white c7, black already gained
 jansteen 3d*:  Therefore b8 is tesuji in this shape

;B[ci]C[
 colombe 2d*: local remarkable move
 jansteen 3d*:  When you want to play a skilful move in the lower-right corner, which one?
 imp NR : quite possible:)
 c24 4k*:  or test move?
 jansteen 3d*:  try: "translate tesuji" for Chinese translation
 jansteen 3d*:  test move is yosumi, yose-miru
 jansteen 3d*:  Try to find a white move in the LR which has two follow-up moves
 imp NR : p2?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, imp, p2!
]
;W[or]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Which follow-up moves, imp?
 imp NR : r3 and m3
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, correct
 colombe 2d*: imp, you're too strong

;W[jo]C[
 imp NR : too lucky:)
 jansteen 3d*:  k5 is aiming l2 follow-up

;B[lq]
;W[rq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move is strange (to me)
 imp NR : ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Looks like a typo :)
 imp NR : to me too:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Good, so I'm not crazy :)
]
;B[pr]C[
 imp NR : how about b q2 now?
]
;W[fr]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White f2 was follow-up of d2
]
;B[gp]C[
 c24 4k*:  Honda is a japanese production
 imp NR : only explanation: w cannot live in LR
 jansteen 3d*:  This move has either g2 or h4 follow-up
 jansteen 3d*:  (pro's always have multiple purpose moves)
]
;W[eq]
;B[hp]
;W[il]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, imp, white now has some outside sente moves like q5 and t5
 jansteen 3d*:  so in a sense white s3 strengthens the outside :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Black to attack the j8 group, how?
 jansteen 3d*:  Consider whole board when thinking about attacking move
 colombe 2d*: j10
 colombe 2d*: or k11
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, colombe!
 imp NR : j10
]
;B[ij]C[
 colombe 2d*: build moyo at the top
 jansteen 3d*:  This move makes white shiver
 jansteen 3d*:  While white now walks horizontally towards q9, black will build a huge moyo
 colombe 2d*: moyo is like airport !
 krugman 5k*: moyo = lake?
 jansteen 3d*:  White will walk neutral points, black valuable ones
 jansteen 3d*:  Let's see what happens
]
;W[md]C[
 imp NR : muo2 yang4
 jansteen 3d*:  Before white lets black get a perfect moyo he places some troops inside
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's next move?
 imp NR : try trans moyo next time:)
 jansteen 3d*:  l17 is correct direction, shape can be imporved upon
 krugman 5k*: m17? make w heavy?
 imp NR : l16 seems better
 jansteen 3d*:  m17, then white won't connect, krugman
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, l16 is the move
]
;B[kd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Attack the whole white invasion force
 jansteen 3d*:  This is important, think big when attacking
 jansteen 3d*:  Don't go for peanuts, go for the whole thing
 krugman 5k*: :)

 colombe 2d*: k14
 colombe 2d*: c17 is like playong go while fire in house
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's wall in upper-right is close to getting weak now
 jansteen 3d*:  For example with white m17 and p11 it's very weak
 jansteen 3d*:  So black decides to pump extra energy in this group and taking points as well
]
;B[qk]C[
 colombe 2d*: yes :)
 imp NR : and attack on w group as a whole

 krugman 5k*: thx jan
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, interesting game
 jansteen 3d*:  This was one of the two games lost by O Rissei in the Meijin league

 jansteen 3d*:  The winner of their play-off game will play Cho Chikun, title holder
 jansteen 3d*:  win100, try translate

 jansteen 3d*:  Cho in title match != Cho in some kind of game
 imp NR : i think cho almost unbeatable by japanese pro's
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, another Kobayashi-Cho match would also be interesting, after so many years
 zorg 14k*:  how old is Cho ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Well, betting options when title match starts :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Cho is 40
 iplr 17k :  40 yrs young! :-)

 jansteen 3d*:  What did Ryu Shikun do in his last game?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yo Kagen married this month to Chinen Kaori, hope this will help his Go
 jansteen 3d*:  Chinen Kaori is the female professional who played Rui Naiwei earlier this year
 jansteen 3d*:  Thanks gutsu, I will update the WWW page
