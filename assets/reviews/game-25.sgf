  jansteen, 3d*: So black defended the corner
    cygnus,12k*:  ; question. does a14 use the aji of B11 stones?
  fernando,10k*:  tell aise hello aise
       imp, NR : sure cygnus (next move: a12)
  fernando,10k*:  stats aise

;B[ab]C[
  jansteen, 3d*: Right
]
;W[ah]C[
    cygnus,12k*:  ; thanks imp. I thought so.
  jansteen, 3d*: This move is the second point of a14
  jansteen, 3d*: So now black's group is very weak, and besides \
white gained some territory

;B[cm]C[
    cygnus,12k*:  ; very nice.
  jansteen, 3d*: Next move by white makes sense

  jansteen, 3d*: Yes, black alive now in UL
   tmartin,10k*:  b can take lead by, say, r17?
  jansteen, 3d*: This female tournament is interesting, winner stays....
  jansteen, 3d*: So as long as you win, you keep on playing

  jansteen, 3d*: Yes club, bottom is interesting now
  jansteen, 3d*: r17 martin, why?
   bomb008, 4k*:  so, who is better now?
  jansteen, 3d*: White is better
       imp, NR : reasonably close i think?
   tmartin,10k*:  black is ahead in territory ... needs to secure \
edges and
  jansteen, 3d*: Black's lower-right is thin, left side group not \
100percent alive
   tmartin,10k*:  avoid losing ground
  jansteen, 3d*: Also top thin since white's UL so strong now
    cygnus,12k*:  W can invade at R6

;B[hq]C[
    xuelin, 2d*:  w good.
      club, 3d*: yes, w is thick now...
     raffa, 3k :  jansteen what does it mean UL?
  jansteen, 3d*: UL = upper-left
]

    xuelin, 2d*:

b already has a weak group...

       imp, NR : yes:)

  jansteen, 3d*: White can cut now, but the move played seems "cooler"
  jansteen, 3d*: Exactly, imp
]
;W[jl]C[
   bomb008, 4k*:  is lower side white safe?
       imp, NR : n13 next big

aims two cuts, g9 and...?

C[
      club, 3d*: imp strong!
  jansteen, 3d*: To win without fighting is pro-style :)
       imp, NR : is that bigger than n13?
  jansteen, 3d*: There is some aji left in LR imp
  jansteen, 3d*: q2 for example
       imp, NR : q2?
       imp, NR : ic
  jansteen, 3d*: Black's next moves take care of that

       imp, NR : cut at h7
  jansteen, 3d*: Exactly, white g6 cuts either h5 or h7
  jansteen, 3d*: This explains black's next move
