 jansteen 3d*:  Hi :)
 jansteen 3d*:  A farewell game for capd
 jansteen 3d*:  Last week we replayed a game where white played amashi
 jansteen 3d*:  This game illustrates amashi again, but now even more extreme
 jansteen 3d*:  When a player plays amashi he tries to limit the opponents prospectives
 jansteen 3d*:  When he succeeds well, he expects to win by receiving the komio
 jansteen 3d*:  komio? komi :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi zion, happy to see you again
 jansteen 3d*:  The french dove might be recovering from the congress?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, typo, komi
]
;W[dd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, I gave away that white will play amashi, so moves should be easy to predict this time :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Not drunk I think, tired :)
]
;B[pq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right r5 would fit amashi strategy
]
;W[oc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  correct zion
 jansteen 3d*:  preventing shimari and right side influence
]
;B[cp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
]
;W[qo]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Correct
]
;B[pe]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 jansteen 3d*:  Everyone should be able to get next one
 jansteen 3d*:  right zion
]
;W[qj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  r10 prevents the perfect r9 pincer by black
 jansteen 3d*:  o16 is black's priviledge malf, right
 jansteen 3d*:  But with o16 black builds influence for right side which is already taken by white
 mmarc 3k*: insnt n17 betterthan o16 for r10 in front of wal?
 jansteen 3d*:  n17 seems a bit close to p17
 jansteen 3d*:  But you're right about the direction
]
;B[np]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next (amashi)?
 kawasaki NR : hm... something in lower left... e4?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right lower-left is direction for amashi
 jansteen 3d*:  well, lower-edge to be more precise
 jansteen 3d*:  closer :)
 jansteen 3d*:  White just wants a group there, no fighting or pincering
 Tu8lu 2d*:  so j3
 kawasaki NR : for just group, maybe d3?
 mmarc 3k*: who is playing? look like jowa - shusaku
 jansteen 3d*:  White wants a relaxed game without large territories or fighting
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, Tu
]
;W[iq]C[
 mmarc 3k*: j3 ?
 Tu8lu 2d*:  this must be an old game
 Tu8lu 2d*:  not mordan style
 jansteen 3d*:  This stone can settle with either m3 or e3
 jansteen 3d*:  1996-10-02: Ota Seido (9p,W) vs Yokota Shigeaki (9p,B)
 jansteen 3d*:  Not old, but old strategy
 mmarc 3k*: thx jan

 jansteen 3d*:  Next move?
 Tu8lu 2d*:  s2
 jansteen 3d*:  Think carefully malf
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move already guessed by some
 jansteen 3d*:  Important point, shouldn't miss it!
 jansteen 3d*:  malf?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, very good all of you :)

 jansteen 3d*:  How malf?
 Tu8lu 2d*:  j5 or n6
 mmarc 3k*: n6
]
;B[mn]C[
 Tu8lu 2d*:  ????
 jansteen 3d*:  Very importanr this move
 Tu8lu 2d*:  b's turn??
 Tu8lu 2d*:  ops
 Tu8lu 2d*:  b's turn b get n6 b too good locally
 jansteen 3d*:  l4 doesn't seem proper with a possible n6 by white possible
 mmarc 3k*: j5 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Black strengthens his muscles preparing to attack either white group
 Tu8lu 2d*:  c10 or j5 now
 jansteen 3d*:  (as we will see in the game he will actually attack both of them)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, n6 solid, honte, proper style
 hawi 2k*: clearly b overall board position feels good
 jansteen 3d*:  White wants to strengthen right side group now, how (think creative)?
 jansteen 3d*:  Good zion
 jansteen 3d*:  But also think amashi :)
 jansteen 3d*:  r18 interesting  :)
 jansteen 3d*:  malf is getting the feel for amashi :)
]
;W[lc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next black move is normal
 hawi 2k*: what is amashi?
 Tu8lu 2d*:  i like j5 now
 jansteen 3d*:  Black thinks big
 jansteen 3d*:  Don't get confused by white's small-scale strategy
]
;B[cf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  amashi means what the italians call catenacio
 jansteen 3d*:  Prevent the opponent from playing, and try to win by the komi :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next white?
 jansteen 3d*:  right jones
 Tu8lu 2d*:  c10
 jansteen 3d*:  White dfoesn't want to start a fight zion
 kawasaki NR : f17?
 jansteen 3d*:  Tu has correct direction
 Tu8lu 2d*:  c9
 jansteen 3d*:  How can white make miai two point extension?
]

 jansteen 3d*:  But remember those hints when playing, they can be useful sometimes
 jansteen 3d*:  They can help focussing sometimes
]
;B[ho]C[

 mix 13k : hi:)
 jansteen 3d*:  White is just interested in two eyes locally
 jansteen 3d*:  Doesn't look beautiful, but very clear
 mmarc 3k*: why not k2/L2 in stead of k4?
 jansteen 3d*:  Next black move? (upper-left)
 Tu8lu 2d*:  c11 of cuz
 kawasaki NR : c17?

 Tu8lu 2d*:  b3 i mean
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi mix :)
]
;W[bo]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi mix :)
 kawasaki NR : b3 seemed obvious for black -- white can't afford to unsettle too much
 kawasaki NR : so white has to b5...
 jansteen 3d*:  Hopeless network, sorry about that
]
;B[dq]C[
 kawasaki NR : now black makes some corner territory?
]
;W[id]C[
 kawasaki NR : hm... q17?
 jansteen 3d*:  This concludes the opening of this game
