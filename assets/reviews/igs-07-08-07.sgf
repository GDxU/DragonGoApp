 jansteen 3d*:  Hi :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Didn't study this game so not many comments
 jansteen 3d*:  right direcat, but not much teaching :)
 imp NR : hoi, ik ben er:)
 imp NR : hi everyone:)

 imp NR : means: hi, i have arived:)

 jansteen 3d*:  Like my game yesterday :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Pro's only play hoshi nowadays, they don't like complicated joseki
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, while Ryu Shikun is living and studying in Japan
 jansteen 3d*:  Pro's skip joseki and concenrtate on middle game

 jansteen 3d*:  c11 another fashionable move
 jansteen 3d*:  To be honest, I don't know the idea of the small extension
 jansteen 3d*:  Anyone any ideas?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, new way of playing
 jansteen 3d*:  Not sure if fashionable is English though
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, maybe that's the reason
 imp NR : seems black wants a stone in that direction to neutralise the white wall after f4, and c10 would be too far away...
 jansteen 3d*:  yes, imp, maybe
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move also very weird
 jansteen 3d*:  I put a beer on next move prediction
 jansteen 3d*:  pls give us your guesses :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, or a wine, or a tea :)
 jansteen 3d*:  both wrong
 jansteen 3d*:  wrong
 haihe 2k*:  f4?
 jansteen 3d*:  No, this bet is one-sided malf :)
 jansteen 3d*:  wrong
 jansteen 3d*:  wrong
 jansteen 3d*:  no-one will guess next move
 jansteen 3d*:  wrong
 jansteen 3d*:  wrong
 jansteen 3d*:  Shall I play?
 jansteen 3d*:  imp?
 jansteen 3d*:  one guess of imp?
 imp NR : still thinking how w can be stubborn here:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Not at all stubborn move, next one
 jansteen 3d*:  very relaxed move
 jansteen 3d*:  no malf, sorry
 imp NR : c6:)
 jansteen 3d*:  wrong :)
 jansteen 3d*:  pfew...
]
;W[kq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Weird, isn't it?
 imp NR : not quit
 jansteen 3d*:  White considers d4 as an invasion of a black moyo
 jansteen 3d*:  wrong zion :)
 jansteen 3d*:  :)
 dong 3d*: c6
 jansteen 3d*:  Well, maybe zion is right about white's thinking but black didn't obey
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi dong
 dong 3d*: hi, jan
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, dong got direction right

 jansteen 3d*:  Very "modern" Go this :)
 dong 3d*: n3?
 jansteen 3d*:  Good dong

;B[mq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White plays kind of amashi Go
 dong 3d*: when was this game played? jan
 jansteen 3d*:  amashi is trying to keep game close and win by the komi
 jansteen 3d*:  In July I think dong
 dong 3d*: guess h5, just normal
 jansteen 3d*:  No, 29th of June
]
;W[hn]C[
 dong 3d*: ic
 jansteen 3d*:  Not quite malf, hard to give one-word translation
 jansteen 3d*:  It's a concept
]
;B[fm]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move is natural
 jansteen 3d*:  Ideas?
 dong 3d*: r14?
 jansteen 3d*:  related to lower-left fighting
 jansteen 3d*:  When they switch to right side I will ask again
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move is in lower-left
 dong 3d*: d10?
 imp NR : d10?
 jansteen 3d*:  Sorry, I'm not clear
 jansteen 3d*:  d10 right idea but too aggressive :)
 dong 3d*: then h8:)
]
;W[cl]C[
 dong 3d*: way off :(
 jansteen 3d*:  Taking points while inviting more stones on dame points by black
 jansteen 3d*:  The f7 group looks a bit useless this way
 dong 3d*: g8 now?
 jansteen 3d*:  White's l3 strategy works quite well, locally

 jansteen 3d*:  This game is very strange
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's h5 was severe, white trouble keeping his forces together here
 jansteen 3d*:  Now, when white j2, black will h2, so white plays tesuji
 dong 3d*: yes
]
;W[nq]
;B[mp]
;W[ir]
;B[hr]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  But white decides to sacrifice h3 anyway here
 jansteen 3d*:  h6 was loose shape, so white could expect bad aji in his shape

 jansteen 3d*:  Next white? (right side)
 imp NR : r9
 imp NR : or r10
 dong 3d*: r14
 jansteen 3d*:  White uses r3 and p5 weaknesses with next move
 imp NR : r6?
 jansteen 3d*:  Not uses, but more "glares at"
 dong 3d*: then r6

 jansteen 3d*:  good

 jansteen 3d*:  The natural move
 jansteen 3d*:  Any ideas for next move?
 jansteen 3d*:  right spirit cwrk :)
 imp NR : p5?
]
;W[qf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  p5 and p10 would both strengthen the white group, this does so indirectly by weakening r12

 jansteen 3d*:  White has to deal with the black potential in top-middle, ideas for next move?
 jansteen 3d*:  haihe, depends on white's skills dealing with the top-middle
 imp NR : k16?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, k16 is one weak spot in black's moyo
 jansteen 3d*:  l13 moves the group of white stones
 jansteen 3d*:  m16 is another idea, although more risky than k16
 imp NR : e11?
 jansteen 3d*:  m16 is not 100 percent kikashi
]
;W[jf]C[
 imp NR : ah, the normal one:)
 jansteen 3d*:  White k14 moves the group white keeping k16 and m16 in reserve
 jansteen 3d*:  Next black move is tesuji
 imp NR : h14 now?
 jansteen 3d*:  (Black wants to split f17 from k14)
 imp NR : oh:(
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, direcat, tesuji, not well known by amateurs
 jansteen 3d*:  f16 is direct approach, try to find more subtle move
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes zion, you got it!
]
;B[fb]C[
 imp NR : good, zion!
 jansteen 3d*:  The idea is that usually white wants to answer e18
 jansteen 3d*:  But then black f16 becomes kikashi
 jansteen 3d*:  black f16 in sente (kikashi) is too hard for white's center, so....
]
;W[ec]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This exchange gains some points for black
 jansteen 3d*:  So white's weak group already brought points to the attacker
 jansteen 3d*:  kikashi is forcing move
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi dimas, missed you in Marseille!
 jansteen 3d*:  Remember white's m16 and k16 options (forcing moves)?
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's next move Takes care of them, ideas?

 jansteen 3d*:  Black's next move sets a new target, ideas?

 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, k2 right direction :)
