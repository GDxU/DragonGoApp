;B[qd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi
]
;W[dd]
;B[pq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Do yuo know Yuki Satoshi?
]
;W[oc]
;B[cp]
;W[po]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  The traditional Shusaku variation adapted to modern views
 jansteen 3d*:  Yuki Satoshi is from the Kansai Ki-in
 jansteen 3d*:  He is young and promising, this is his first appearance in a title match
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, a few weeks ago I replayed a lightning game from him
 jansteen 3d*:  In this position black can determine the flow of the game, ideas?
 jansteen 3d*:  Sorry, what do you meran, direwolf?
 jansteen 3d*:  Ah, I see. No, black plays differently nowadays
]
;B[ld]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  M16 is almost always played in this position
 jansteen 3d*:  It takes the initiative
 jansteen 3d*:  While the upper side moves downward, q5 will be weakened automatically
 jansteen 3d*:  :)
 jansteen 3d*:  White's next move anticipates the weakening of q5
]
;W[qq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Of course black gets something in return, which move?
 jansteen 3d*:  Any ideas?
 jansteen 3d*:  pls tell them direwolf, i'll come back to r5 in a minute
 jansteen 3d*:  First r5: white will answer r4 and next either connect with q4 or r6 (capture)
 jansteen 3d*:  So r5 is not possible in the lower-right shape
 jansteen 3d*:  The usual moves in the lower-right are: r2, r4, or tenuki
 jansteen 3d*:  Next, p16 or q17: both moves are logical: two black stones against one white one
 jansteen 3d*:  The majority promises an advanteous fight
]
;B[pc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White's next move is also logical, pls think about my previous remarks
 jansteen 3d*:  think = remeber
 jansteen 3d*:  remember
 jansteen 3d*:  Very good
]
;W[pr]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  q2 almost completely neutralises q3 by preventing black r2
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's next moves create some aji in the lower-right
]
;B[qp]
;W[pp]
;B[oq]
;W[qr]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White r2 can also be p2, but then black has r2 aji left, now r4 can move to r5 (later on)
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's next move is logical considering this aji, ideas?
 jansteen 3d*:  That's right direwolf
 jansteen 3d*:  :)
]
;B[qk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black r9 developes upper-right and aims r5
]
;W[oe]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move prevents black to neutralise p17 (by playing p16)
 jansteen 3d*:  This move is similar to black's r4 move
]
;B[pf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  k17 is correct direction
 jansteen 3d*:  Good
]
;W[gc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move accomplishes two things: weakens m16 and slightly claims the corner
]
;B[eq]
;W[ck]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  about black j17 direwolf: this move wouldn't affect upper-left too much and also wouldn't attack p17 too much
 jansteen 3d*:  So white is not too eager to prevent it
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi David
 jansteen 3d*:  c9 can still extend to c6 so it's the limit
]
;B[lg]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Right
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's last move actually is aiming at this invasion while attacking p17 group
 jansteen 3d*:  Not really direwolf, but I'll come back to that in a minute
 jansteen 3d*:  First p17 is urgent
 jansteen 3d*:  White settles this group now
]
;W[mc]
;B[lc]
;W[pb]
;B[qb]
;W[nb]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Now black to invade left side, ideas?
]
;B[ci]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, c11 is the usual move
 jansteen 3d*:  White's next also makes sense
 jansteen 3d*:  Very good David
]
;W[ce]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White takes territory while preventing black to make an extension to c14
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's next?
]
;B[cm]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Good :)
 dag 5k*: c7 seems obvious... remove white's extension, and pincer
 jansteen 3d*:  White's next?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right dag
 dag 5k*: hm... touger... e9 seems clear... a one point jump to the centre is always correct"
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, e9 usual, white's move also logical though
 dag 5k*: so maybe d7 to make shape?
]
;W[ej]C[
 dag 5k*: ah... moving slightly more towards where there are white stones
 jansteen 3d*:  e10 is attacking variation on e9 (running variation)
 jansteen 3d*:  Right dag
 dag 5k*: hm... black e11?
 jansteen 3d*:  Black e11 usually is forbidden, white f11, black e12, white f10 would follow
 jansteen 3d*:  Very good club!
]
;B[df]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move "leans" on white's position while lightly jumping out
]
;W[dh]
;B[ch]
;W[cf]
;B[dg]C[
 dag 5k*: d11?
]
;W[eh]
;B[cg]
;W[ff]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White is attacking severely
]
;B[ee]C[
 dag 5k*: black can still connect with b9, if needs to?
]
;W[fd]
;B[fe]
;W[ge]
;B[gf]
;W[he]
;B[fg]
;W[hf]
;B[gg]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  That's right dag, white's next move prevents this
]
;W[dm]
;B[cl]
;W[dk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's group needs enforcement, what's direction?
 jansteen 3d*:  Good
]
;B[gi]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move enforces black's group while weakening white's group
]
;W[dn]
;B[cn]
;W[gj]
;B[hj]
;W[gk]
;B[fi]
;W[do]
;B[co]
;W[hk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Go is all about playing stones on valuable points
 jansteen 3d*:  h9 is such a move
 jansteen 3d*:  treatening j10
 jansteen 3d*:  When both keep on walking here white gains
 jansteen 3d*:  Because lower side is cvaluable side while upper is almost completely neutral points
 jansteen 3d*:  So it's natural that black switches direction here
 dag 5k*: can black settle/live with e11?
 jansteen 3d*:  Black can play c10 (with b9 or e11 next)
]
;B[of]C[
 dag 5k*: ah, yes... the equivalent, starting at a different point
]
;W[lb]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move for black?
 dag 5k*: lower side looks big, now... j3?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, dag, black probably will start with e11 btw
 dag 5k*: hm... how about s4?
 dag 5k*: reopen that fight?
 jansteen 3d*:  With j10 available the white group is almost unvurnerable
]
;B[qo]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  l4 for black doesn't affect the white center group so feels a bit slow
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, good direwolf :)
]
;W[qn]
;B[rn]
;W[pn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Thanks club :)
 dag 5k*: s7
]
;B[qm]
;W[pm]
;B[ql]
;W[rq]
;B[ro]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White's next move?
 dag 5k*: o3?
 jansteen 3d*:  Good dag!
]
;W[nq]C[
 dag 5k*: I've been wanting to play that for a while! :-)
 jansteen 3d*:  tesuji: makes p2 and p4 miai
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's p3 are even captured: if p4, then white can push and geta
 jansteen 3d*:  Next white move?
 jansteen 3d*:  Sorry, black
 jansteen 3d*:  True, white very thick, and doing well in territory
 dag 5k*: ok... with o3, white is thick... checking extension
 jansteen 3d*:  What's the direction of play here?
 dag 5k*: so... j3, maybe?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, j3 is direction of play
 jansteen 3d*:  Very good club
]
;B[hq]C[
 dag 5k*: ah... more conservative, slightly, due to white thickness?
 dag 5k*: j3 would be overplay, right?
 jansteen 3d*:  Controlling bottom while staying connected to e3 (important)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, dag
]
;W[fp]
;B[ep]
;W[fo]
;B[gr]
;W[ij]C[
 dag 5k*: hm... that is interesting sequence... I would have just f3
]
;B[ei]C[
 dag 5k*: b9?
]
;W[me]
;B[le]C[
 dag 5k*: b9 seems sente, and is big as well
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, but b9 is endgame, white's priviledge
 dag 5k*: hm... right
]
;W[mg]
;B[mh]
;W[ng]
;B[kh]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White is using center thickness by isolating black's m17 group
]
;W[nh]
;B[ph]C[
 dag 5k*: o12, threatens blacks territory... black protects...
 jansteen 3d*:  Black protects territory since otherwise he can not compete with white's
 dag 5k*: but is further cutoff
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, russel :)
]
;W[mi]
;B[ih]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White n11/black j12 is nice exchange for white: valuable move for neutral point
]
;W[jc]C[
 dag 5k*: and, k17, takes profit
]
;B[ho]
;W[ip]
;B[hp]
;W[kq]C[
 dag 5k*: k17 is bigger than something around j5/j6?
]
;B[gn]
;W[fn]
;B[ko]
;W[jn]
;B[jq]
;W[jp]
;B[kp]
;W[lq]
;B[jo]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This sequence is very bad for white
 dag 5k*: I was wondering... white does seem to be getting pushed around
 jansteen 3d*:  k17 is huge direwolf, clear cash, pros like that
 jansteen 3d*:  White misread in this sequence at the bottom, very rare for pro
 dag 5k*: right, k17 is territory, j5/j6/j3 are just influence/moyo
 jansteen 3d*:  Now white removes the bad aji in upper-left
 jansteen 3d*:  Black can start confusion with: c17
]
;W[ed]
;B[jd]C[
 dag 5k*: e16 seems gote... end game move?
]
;W[id]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, e16 prevents black c17 life in the corner (big endgame started)
]
;B[kc]
;W[kb]
;B[gm]
;W[kj]
;B[mp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This black move is another misread, now by black
]
;W[lp]
;B[lo]
;W[mo]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  n4 is mochikomi now
 jansteen 3d*:  Typical first game of title match: both players nervous :)
 dag 5k*: mochikomi??
 dag 5k*: ah, thanks dsaun
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, mochi komi = invasion which dies :)
 jansteen 3d*:  A "thank you" stone
 dag 5k*: thanks jan... "translate mochikomi" didn't help :-)
]
;B[ic]
;W[jb]
;B[ie]
;W[hd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Try: "translate mochi" in such cases dag
 jansteen 3d*:  club, black tried something else...
]
;B[no]
;W[mn]
;B[mq]
;W[mr]
;B[np]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next white move? (you can win the game here)
 dag 5k*: hm... m6?
 dag 5k*: o2 too obvious
 dag 5k*: or, maybe, p2?
]
;W[nn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White read the semeai
]
;B[lr]
;W[kr]
;B[nr]
;W[ls]
;B[ns]
;W[jr]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black looses all his stones, and resigned
 dag 5k*: thanks jansteen
 jansteen 3d*:  If black wouldn't have played o4 the game would have been very close
 jansteen 3d*:  Sure :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Tomorrow game 2 of this match
 jansteen 3d*:  This match will be close I think
 jansteen 3d*:  These players are both good competitors
 jansteen 3d*:  With completely different style though
 jansteen 3d*:  This was: 22 Gosei, gm 1: Yoda Norimoto (9p,W) vs. Yuki Satoshi (9p,B)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yuki is close fighter, Yoda is more the classic Go player: shape and territory
 jansteen 3d*:  I predict Yuki will win, but close it will be
 jansteen 3d*:  This game gives us amateurs hope: even pros misread
 jansteen 3d*:  :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Oh really?
 jansteen 3d*:  I know a 6d ama who thinks he can read as well as pros, I can't believe it
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, club, misreads also give interesting games :)
 jansteen 3d*:  I guess maybe difference between average pro and top pro (like Ma, Cho and Takemiya) might be reading as well
 jansteen 3d*:  6d European club, not 6d* IGS-er
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, that's about right I think
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, tomorrow the continuation of this match, thanks for joining!
