 colombe 2d*: go on, jan
 jansteen 3d*:  guys and girls i mean :)

;W[dp]C[
 colombe 2d*: i always missed the end :))
 jansteen 3d*:  Fujisawa Shuko (black) is a special kind of player
 jansteen 3d*:  He's the kind of player who generates moves in his stomach, not brain
 jansteen 3d*:  He can play brilliantly but also make the most terrible mistakes
 jansteen 3d*:  On average good I think :)

 jansteen 3d*:  Fortunately, the pros also tend to experiment recently a lot
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, Shuko is old
 tihi NR : is it ok to ask clueless questions?
 jansteen 3d*:  Can someone look up his age?
 colombe 2d*: cool; tomorrow, me yoo
 jansteen 3d*:  sure tihi, those are the best questions
 tihi NR : *flip*

 colombe 2d*: j15
 colombe 2d*: if move, then j15
 jansteen 3d*:  g13 would allow capture

 tomcat 5k*:  f13 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  j13 or k13 would be usual move here, agree
 colombe 2d*: what means sharp ?
 jansteen 3d*:  sharp means: just possible, but on the edge
 jansteen 3d*:  f13 and f12 both aim at damezumari of f14, but too directly
 jansteen 3d*:  What does black want with his e14 group?
 colombe 2d*: e11 !

 jansteen 3d*:  White treatens capture of cutting stones with j13

 jansteen 3d*:  Hi malf
 colombe 2d*: hi malf
]
;B[jg]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, k13 usually preferable since it's faster, and more useful when attacking (later) k16
]
;W[hh]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Nice move this, what's white's idea?
 craig 8k*: white want regain center influence
 jansteen 3d*:  More concrete craig, pls see carefully
 ChickenJoe 4d :  still threaten capture H15 stones
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi enrico
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, Joe, how?
 ChickenJoe 4d :  J14
 jansteen 3d*:  Right
 colombe 2d*: whites threats j14
 jansteen 3d*:  White treatens j14 capture
 jansteen 3d*:  Now what's shape for black?
 ChickenJoe 4d :  j12
 dag 5k*: k14?

 jansteen 3d*:  We can learn a lot from the pros
]
;W[bd]C[
 colombe 2d*: black should be strong here, because weak at c14
 ChickenJoe 4d :  thx colombe.
 jansteen 3d*:  White takes this point to strengthen this group, weaken c14 group and f18 group and thus ....
 jansteen 3d*:  strengthen k16 indirectly as well
 jansteen 3d*:  Next black?
 jianhui 4k*:  c11
 dag 5k*: j18/k18 -- make base, and remove base for k16 group?
 colombe 2d*: e10 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  No club, makes sense next move
 jansteen 3d*:  dag, j18 would be emergency, try more possitive move first
 jansteen 3d*:  I didn't see any proposal which is correct direction yet
 malf NR : positive? c8 :)
 twofar NR : n16?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, club, that's more like it

 jansteen 3d*:  45th NHK, 1st rnd, 13th gm: Fujisawa Shuko (9p,B) vs Yukawa Mitsuhisa (9p,W)

 breeze 1k*: harder
 colombe 2d*: i like j11 or g12 , but ...
 colombe 2d*: jan said that not direction
]
;W[ek]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Enlarging left side while taking care (somehow) of d6
 breeze 1k*: even we guess the right move, it's probably for not the entirely right reason :)
 jansteen 3d*:  For me too, very hard
 colombe 2d*: j11 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  If now black f9 then white will f8
 jansteen 3d*:  This would create good peeps at f11 and h9
 ChickenJoe 4d :  colombe: B j11, W J12, what B next?
 colombe 2d*: and if black j11 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, black's turn: pls attack white's m15 group

 colombe 2d*: d6 is my style, oveplay !
 colombe 2d*: oups....
 colombe 2d*: sorry ....
 jansteen 3d*:  Rather logical, white ignored d11 and g8 to split black, this is price
 dag 5k*: not overplay, now, with g8 and d11, d9 group is weaker
 jansteen 3d*:  If you forget to collect price, you loose in the end
 jansteen 3d*:  That's why pro's can give us many H-stones :)

 jansteen 3d*:  Which one, club?
 colombe 2d*: both ? :)
 dag 5k*: c4
 jansteen 3d*:  The k13 group can press with o11, so rather safe I think
 dag 5k*: b k13 group still has room to run, and white M15 not solid -- no base
