C[
 jansteen 3d*: This is the JT-cup final 1994: Cho Chikun (b,9p) vs. O Rissei (w,9p)
 jansteen 3d*: Chinese names: Zhao Zhi Xun (b,9p) vs. Wang Li Cheng (w,9p)
 jansteen 3d*: JT is a new Cup, where players are devided in sections by their zodiac sign.
 jansteen 3d*: James Davies described the details in "News from Japan".
 jansteen 3d*: This is an exciting fighting game, so it will be hard to analyse just in a few minutes.
 jansteen 3d*: I won't ask as many questions as usual.

;B[fq]C[
 jansteen 3d*: One of the ways for white to keep black from building a moyo now is to pincer, which move?
 eaj 10k*: j4?
 jansteen 3d*: yes, eaj, j4 is one of them
 eaj 10k*: or h4 maybe
 jansteen 3d*: h4 would be unusual, maybe too hard without backup in lower-right
 eaj 10k*: hmm, true
 jansteen 3d*: Any other suggestions?
 eaj 10k*: h3??
 jansteen 3d*: right, that's the other option

;W[dq]
;B[cp]
;W[do]C[
 eaj 10k*: why is h3 > j4?
 jansteen 3d*: h3 is not better than j4, it's just another choice eaj.
 jansteen 3d*: Also the other suggestion, k4 is very well possible here.

;B[dr]

;W[eq]
;B[cn]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Up to this point is joseki
 LingHuCong 3d*: o4 or n4?
 jansteen 3d*: Ling, those two moves are interesting suggestions
 jansteen 3d*: n4 would be an attempt to settle the lower side with *one* move
 jansteen 3d*: o4 would aim for building further with o6 next.
 jansteen 3d*: White played a steady move instead
]
;W[nq]
;B[pn]C[
 jansteen 3d*: If white would continue here (bottom) he would spend too many moves on one part, so he switches elsewhere now. Where is next?
 eaj 10k*: q-r14 or so?
 Watson 12k*: o17?
 LingHuCong 3d*: r14?
 jansteen 3d*: The choice between r14 and o17 is often decided by the question: "what is the wider area?"
 LingHuCong 3d*: o17
 Watson 12k*: o17
]
;W[nc]C[
 jansteen 3d*: right o17, the wider area
]
;B[pf]
;W[pb]
;B[qc]
;W[kc]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Since white neclected to defend the bottom, an invasion seems natural now, where to start?
 niceguy 3d*: I think l3 can make the  w wall almost useless.
 LingHuCong 3d*: l4?
 xxx 2d*: l3 or l4 seems natural..haflway :)
 eaj 10k*: l3
 jansteen 3d*: You are looking for a move which is severe to both sides
 jansteen 3d*: Both l3 and l4 are soft to both sides.
 jansteen 3d*: l4 doesn't affect the left position much
 eaj 10k*: k3/4?
 jansteen 3d*: right eaj, k3
]
;B[jq]C[
 jansteen 3d*: This move takes the base of both groups, aiming f2 for example, or p3
 niceguy 3d*: don't like k3
 jansteen 3d*: Hi niceguy, why not? :-)
 niceguy 3d*: I would prefer either l3 or even j3!
 jansteen 3d*: l3 is soft to both sides, so missing the target, Japanese: "nurui"
 jansteen 3d*: In English: "half-way, half-done"
 niceguy 3d*: But the h3 grp is too strong to do anything about.
 jansteen 3d*: Left side is not thick niceguy, it would be when white would have added a move at f4
 jansteen 3d*: Let's just see what happened...

;B[fo]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Next?
 Bo ??? :  D6
 jansteen 3d*: right Bo!
 jansteen 3d*: It's important to avoid black from playing there
]
;W[dn]
;B[cm]C[
 jansteen 3d*: But actually, this exchange is already the second profit black made while attacking
 jansteen 3d*: The d6/c7 exchange lost points for white
 niceguy 3d*: actually the d6-c7 exchange does not lose point, but lost the c8 aji.
 jansteen 3d*: Isn't that the same, niceguy?
 jansteen 3d*: Next?
]
;W[fr]C[
 jansteen 3d*: This move is important
 jansteen 3d*: Keeping black weak as well

 jansteen 3d*: Now white took a decision which might have affected the whole game.
 jansteen 3d*: Let's hear your ideas now...
 eaj 10k*: r10
 LingHuCong 3d*: l7?
 Bo ??? :  D8.
 ye 2k : d10
 eaj 10k*: q10
 jansteen 3d*: r10 is very close
 jansteen 3d*: right idea anyway
 LingHuCong 3d*: r8
 Ghopper 26k*: C10?
 niceguy 3d*: r8
 tromp 3k*:  r89
 jansteen 3d*: r8 is also close :-)
 LingHuCong 3d*: q7?
 eaj 10k*: r9!
 ironbird 3d : q8
]
;W[qk]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Was r89: r8/r9 tromp? :-)
 tromp 3k*:  uhm, to be honest, it was r8 mistyped
 jansteen 3d*: Imagining yourself in black's position and trying to device a plan here might be instructive
 Bo ??? :  R7 needed?
 tromp 3k*:  wr5 looks nasty allright
 jansteen 3d*: right Bo, basically you're right, but black prepares it
]
;B[op]
;W[np]
;B[nn]
;W[no]
;B[qm]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Black's aim is a double attack.
 jansteen 3d*: The bottom white groups are not 100% alive yet, and also r9 needs attention.
 jansteen 3d*: It takes great skills to use all this information though.
 eaj 10k*: was r9 mistake then?
 jansteen 3d*: No, eaj, hard to say that, but r9 moved the game into the difficult phase, where the players can show their strength.
 Bo ??? :  R12 my choice.
 jansteen 3d*: r12 is the right idea, but also white prepares the move first.
]
;W[on]
;B[om]
;W[nm]
;B[ol]
;W[qh]C[
 jansteen 3d*: White induced r12 naturally, while slightly strengthening his bottom group first
]
;B[qg]
;W[ph]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Ok, next move is important, where?
 LingHuCong 3d*: o16
 jansteen 3d*: o16 isn't "natural"
 LingHuCong 3d*: still like o16
 jansteen 3d*: Ling, o16 gives points, you can only do that when you get something in return.
 cohiba 2d*:  m16
 ryszard NR : o13
 jansteen 3d*: ryszard is close
 LingHuCong 3d*: o12
 Watson 12k*: o12?
 Bo ??? :  O12?
 jansteen 3d*: Right, Ling, Watson and Bo
]
;B[nh]C[
 jansteen 3d*: o12 says: "I'm serious about this attack"
]
;W[rl]
;B[pj]C[
 jansteen 3d*: This move aims s11
 jansteen 3d*: How to defend it?
 LingHuCong 3d*: s12
]
;W[rh]C[
 jansteen 3d*: right
 jansteen 3d*: While being attacked, it's important to seek counter-attack options as soon as possible
 jansteen 3d*: s12 makes black feel slightly uncomfortable, because white can s14 later on

;B[mf]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Seems black is doing fine here
 Watson 12k*: now o16 looks good :)
 jansteen 3d*: Yes, Watson, o16 is definitely a keypoint in this attack :-)
 Watson 12k*: but?
 jansteen 3d*: But as mentioned earlier: order is important, when played too soon you give away points without returns.
 LingHuCong 3d*: usally o 16 is b's right
 jansteen 3d*: right Ling

;B[ld]C[
 jansteen 3d*: What's black's threat here?
 Watson 12k*: blact threat?   must be n6 then
 jansteen 3d*: No, more straightforward
 eaj 10k*: uhh... m17?
 jansteen 3d*: right m17, and l18 cut is the threat
]
;W[lc]
;B[oj]C[
 LingHuCong 3d*: can b not k17 or k18/m17?
 jansteen 3d*: Yes, sure Ling
 jansteen 3d*: Maybe white wanted the liberties reduced of the m16 group.
