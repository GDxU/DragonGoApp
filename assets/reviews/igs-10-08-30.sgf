 jansteen 3d*:  Hi Malf
]
;W[dd]
;B[pp]
;W[dp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  A long game so not too much time for questions I guess
 jansteen 3d*:  He's contemporary of Ryu Shikun
 jansteen 3d*:  He's from Taiwan, pupil of Oeda Yusuke, 9p
 jansteen 3d*:  He likes to play shogi with Ryu and they are good friends
 jansteen 3d*:  Yo Kagen will take titles within maybe 2-5 years from now
 jansteen 3d*:  The new generation, Yoda, Yo Kagen, Ryu Shikun

;W[qn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Simple question: next?
 colombe 2d*: pincer ?
 malf NR : q9
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, pincer
 jansteen 3d*:  q9 is ok, but game even better
]
;B[ql]C[
 malf NR : r8 then :)
 jansteen 3d*:  This is better since it's more severe on white
 colombe 2d*: r3 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Neighbourhood all black, in that case choose the most severe pincer you can deal with
 malf NR : w in a hard spot
 jansteen 3d*:  In 9 out of ten times white will enter the corner here
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, colombe
 malf NR : r3
]
;W[on]C[
 colombe 2d*: haha
 colombe 2d*: amateur ...
 jansteen 3d*:  p6 is perfectly possible as well, moving towards the center to frustrate black's moyo plans
]
;B[np]
;W[pk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This is joseki
 malf NR : yes, this is not supposed to be good for b
 colombe 2d*: r5 then
 jansteen 3d*:  Hmm, who said so malf?
 jansteen 3d*:  r5 is possible
 malf NR : one of my books, it says this diminishes the influence of q16
 jansteen 3d*:  r5, r9, s6, r7 and next switch to the top
 jansteen 3d*:  I see, inetersting
 jansteen 3d*:  Do you remember the title of the book?
 malf NR : uh, not right away...  let me think a little
]
;B[pl]

;B[pn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This is Yoda style
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 colombe 2d*: R3 or r4 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  How to set white's influence to work?
 malf NR : o5
 colombe 2d*: o16
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, colombe!
 colombe 2d*: am i becoming pro ??? :))
 jansteen 3d*:  malf, o5 is too small to worry about and you don't want black to add a move locally...
 jansteen 3d*:  because of the r3 aji
]
;W[nd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move nicely finishes white's influence along the top
 jansteen 3d*:  Black to enter top, where?
 Pollux 11k :  j16
 jansteen 3d*:  Black wants to settle quickly there
 colombe 2d*: then j or k 17
]
;B[ic]
;W[gc]
;B[ld]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Aiming at white's thin connection here
]
;W[qg]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  r13 tries to deal with it creatively, nice move
]
;B[ph]
;W[oh]
;B[qi]
;W[pg]
;B[nj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This is a lightning game so the pro's play a little bit more naughty than usual
 malf NR : ? isn't this very aggressive?
 colombe 2d*: it's vital point
 jansteen 3d*:  Black is trying to deal with the situation, o10 is sort of yosumi
]
;W[mi]
;B[oi]
;W[ok]C[
 colombe 2d*: what mean yosumi pls
 jansteen 3d*:  White fights back, logical: black has three weak groups now: j17, q16 and o10
 jansteen 3d*:  yosumi = testing
 colombe 2d*: thx
]
;B[ni]
;W[mh]
;B[mk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Now white has one as well: o7
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move?
 colombe 2d*: m6 ?
 omigoshi 4k :  m8
 colombe 2d*: ha ha
 jansteen 3d*:  m6 seems bad shape since it allows black m8 in sente
 colombe 2d*: at least M ...
 jansteen 3d*:  The standard move is m7, when strong this can be m8
 jansteen 3d*:  So: m7 or m8?
 omigoshi 4k : m7
 colombe 2d*: m7 is too easy for bl
 jansteen 3d*:  colombe is right again
]
;W[ll]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  But pls realize, m8 means that at one stage white has to come back to fix n8 cutting point
 jansteen 3d*:  So usually m7 is the proper move
 malf NR : but b position hard
 jansteen 3d*:  The white player read m8 carefully
 omigoshi 4k : m8 seemsss most agressive becs b weak so fair fight
 jansteen 3d*:  Black hard, but when n9 moves the o12 cutting point also needs attention
 jansteen 3d*:  Let's see what happened
]
;B[lk]C[
 malf NR : oh yes, always two sides...
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 colombe 2d*: m6 ?
 omigoshi 4k :  must keep running fight since w weak
 jansteen 3d*:  Right malf, so this fight is dangerous for both
 omigoshi 4k :  bamboo or n6
 malf NR : is l7 shape?
 colombe 2d*: no
 colombe 2d*: shape is m6
 malf NR : right
 colombe 2d*: l7 aloows m6
 colombe 2d*: l9 ? :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move needed calculation again
 jansteen 3d*:  Right colombe :)
]
;W[kk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This is the point white was aiming at when playing m8
 colombe 2d*: i told you, in the congress, i will beat guo :))
 jansteen 3d*:  Wanna bet? :)
 colombe 2d*: :))
]
;B[ml]C[
 tchen 12k*:  who is jansteen?
]
;W[mm]C[
 tchen 12k*:  he play with himself?
 jansteen 3d*:  critical variation here is: m7, l8, m10
 jansteen 3d*:  This is what white read when playing m8
 malf NR : seems b should just give them up
 jansteen 3d*:  Impossible malf, giving m9 away means game is over
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi shuozhuo, this time NHK game
 jansteen 3d*:  We are reading: m7, l8, m10 (at least, I'm reading... :)
 colombe 2d*: doesn't work this sequence, jan
 malf NR : b can't
 jansteen 3d*:  Pls give moves :)
]
;B[kj]
;W[kl]
;B[lj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Who l10?
 malf NR : l11
 colombe 2d*: not me !
 jansteen 3d*:  White k11 now?
 jansteen 3d*:  This is not the game by the way
 colombe 2d*: or l11 !
 jansteen 3d*:  But an important moment
 colombe 2d*: geta ?
 jansteen 3d*:  k11 is also geta
 malf NR : guess if l11, b just m6
 colombe 2d*: right
]
;W[kh]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  n5 is good move!
 jansteen 3d*:  Point is.....
]
;B[jj]
;W[kn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This fight too risky for black
]
;B[ih]C[
 malf NR : now w must n14?
 jansteen 3d*:  Difficult
 jansteen 3d*:  Now n4 seems most important
 jansteen 3d*:  agree, too risky for black
 jansteen 3d*:  I go back
 jansteen 3d*:  This was not played
 jansteen 3d*:  This is the game
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move important but again very sharp
 jansteen 3d*:  Ideas?
 colombe 2d*: k10 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Good question malf :)
 colombe 2d*: only way to defend is attacking
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, m7 cut is most urgent
 jansteen 3d*:  White defended with l6, but played kikashi first
 jansteen 3d*:  Kikashi has to do with the top
 malf NR : that cut
 jansteen 3d*:  :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Ues shouzhuo
 jansteen 3d*:  Nerv-wrecking game this
 malf NR : whew, w defend both cuts
 jansteen 3d*:  Nice flow, agree
 jansteen 3d*:  Now black has many, many options
 colombe 2d*: o17 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Very hard to choose
 malf NR : seems b full of holes
 jansteen 3d*:  Maybe Yoda plays aggressive in lightning Go since usually he plays very solid
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, white seems ok in this fight
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's bottom open for invasion, black's top weak
 jansteen 3d*:  Yoda Norimoto (9p,B) vs Yo Kagen (7p,W)
 jansteen 3d*:  Black strengthens his center while weakening white's center and thus indirectly helping top
 jansteen 3d*:  Taiwanese, but living in Japan
 jansteen 3d*:  tmartin, it's complicated as it is :)

 jansteen 3d*:  Too complicated this for me, sorry, no comments
 jansteen 3d*:  h16 seems very vital, agree
 malf NR : sure looks like b in trouble
]
;B[lf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This also looks nicve though
 jansteen 3d*:  Helping top and aimin go12

 jansteen 3d*:  Black too weak to cut I guess
]
;W[lg]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This finishes the exchange: white connected and thick, black connected/some territory at the top
 jansteen 3d*:  Again I prefer white, but white was better to start with
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, shouzhuo
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move (center group)
 malf NR : b play left edge?
 jansteen 3d*:  ?
 jansteen 3d*:  malf: urgent points before big ones
 malf NR : right...
 jansteen 3d*:  If center is thick/strong you can handle left side from a distance
 malf NR : h10?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right shouzhuo

;W[hq]C[
 colombe 2d*: sandbagger :)
 jansteen 3d*:  shouzhuo very strong :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next black move is nice (dealing with f6 cutting point), where?
 jansteen 3d*:  k7 doesn't work juan, pls check
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, leaning with d7
]
;B[dm]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Locally, not m4 but k3 is efficient
 jansteen 3d*:  Usual procedure would be: d6, e7, b8, k3
 jansteen 3d*:  right shouzhuo! So another fight.....

 jansteen 3d*:  Agree, too difficult
 jansteen 3d*:  Thanks colombe, see you soon

 haihe 2k*:  e15?
 jansteen 3d*:  Funny, Yasuda corrected this mistake a few times in our games........

 jansteen 3d*:  Lower-right is indeed white's next major project
 joachim 3k*: b leads by 4 points
 jansteen 3d*:  How did you count lower-right joachim?
