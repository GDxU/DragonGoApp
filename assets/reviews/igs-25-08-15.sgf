;B[pd]
;W[dp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Anyone knows how Yu Bin is performing recently in China?
]
;B[fq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Kobayashi Koichi had a hard time the last few years
 jansteen 3d*:  His wife being sick and dying is very tough
]
;W[cn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, the competition is awesome
]
;B[qp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  That's right denots, and Kitani was Kobayashi's teacher
]
;W[dc]
;B[kq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This is the second game I replayed today with small Chinese
 jansteen 3d*:  (f3, l3 and r4)
 jansteen 3d*:  In the other game white played r10, black r13, white r7
]
;W[qf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move was also played by an opponent of me recently
 jansteen 3d*:  I critised it because black can play an efficient move now, which one?
 jansteen 3d*:  Not Yasuda, malf :)
 mondongo 2k*: r11 or so?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes malf
 jansteen 3d*:  Also mondongo has the right idea
]
;B[pi]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move attacks the white stone and builds the bottom moyo
 jansteen 3d*:  denots, what is next move here?
 gajja NR :  what about simply r12
 WatchOnly NR : o17
 jansteen 3d*:  o17 seems logical for top
 jansteen 3d*:  But lower-right is most important now
 jansteen 3d*:  r12 seems less balanced than q11
 WatchOnly NR : p4
 jansteen 3d*:  denots, you've read the commentary by Yasuda on lower-right shape
 jansteen 3d*:  What's white's next move?
 jansteen 3d*:  p4 is traditional entry point, but white can do better
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, denots
 jansteen 3d*:  watch i mean, sorry :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Well, that's what the pro played malf, probably to keep r17 available
]
;W[qn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  What's a klutz? :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Maybe playing upper-right is aji keshi denots?
 jansteen 3d*:  FAX, do you know this right side shape?
 jansteen 3d*:  Probably this has been played before
 jansteen 3d*:  Next black's move is most severe answer to r6
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, r17 or p14, or p12 even, depending how black answers r6
]
;B[po]
;W[qk]
;B[pn]
;W[pm]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This game is hard to comment on because it features so much fighting
 jansteen 3d*:  We just passed the quiet part :)
 jansteen 3d*:  q6 follow-up is severe malf
 jansteen 3d*:  It is more interesting than p4, which is normal
 jansteen 3d*:  Black keeps white busy while building the bottom
]
;B[pl]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Another follow-up
 jansteen 3d*:  If now white r7 then black p7 and the bottom grows
 jansteen 3d*:  kikashi is forcing move
 jansteen 3d*:  So white decided to fight
]
;W[om]
;B[ql]
;W[qm]
;B[rl]
;W[no]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, this is the game, denots
]
;B[np]
;W[mp]
;B[nq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Shape?
 jansteen 3d*:  n5 would allow p6 cut, malf
 jansteen 3d*:  m7 comes close
 jansteen 3d*:  p6 is too one-sided
 jansteen 3d*:  Which ladder malf?
 jansteen 3d*:  p6 only connects o5, doesn't affect the right side
]
;W[mm]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  n7 defends n5 and affects the right side group as well
 jansteen 3d*:  Which ladder are you guys talking about pls?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, n5, and then?
 jansteen 3d*:  haha :)
 jansteen 3d*:  denots is seeing ladders :)
]
;B[mq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move?
 jansteen 3d*:  We were talking about white n5 instead of n7 sulla
 WatchOnly NR : o17
 mondongo 2k*: p14
 jansteen 3d*:  o17 too soft, o11 too kind
 jansteen 3d*:  o8 too slow and solid
 gajja NR :  q10
 jansteen 3d*:  cut: o5 and n4 are forcing moves, you may sacrifice them
]
;W[of]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Anyone guessed this?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right sulla
 jansteen 3d*:  So good direction bugs, good
 jansteen 3d*:  Disadvantage of p15 is that it gives away so much territory while you can not kill the black group
 jansteen 3d*:  True cut, but timing is important :)
]
;B[nd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next? :)
 jansteen 3d*:  White plays kind of tesuji shape
 mondongo 2k*: n14
 jansteen 3d*:  o11 or n11 is straightforward move, agree
 jansteen 3d*:  yes denots!
]
;W[oj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Looks more interesting than just o11 or n11
 jansteen 3d*:  Please note the relation with white's p7 and n7 stones
 jansteen 3d*:  FAX knows black's next move I bet
 jansteen 3d*:  no denots :)
 WatchOnly NR : o8
 jansteen 3d*:  Oh, ok, I don't wait then :)
]
;B[pj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  According to FAX this way to cut is most natura response to p10 tesuji
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi FAX, am I right?
 jansteen 3d*:  No bugs
 jansteen 3d*:  Xiaolin
 jansteen 3d*:  thanks 00000000
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, FAX, when commenting a game of denots against ?
]
;W[pk]
;B[ok]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Semi-final
]
;W[ol]
;B[nk]
;W[rk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This is what Yasuda means my natural flow of the stones
 jansteen 3d*:  Black looses some, but also gains some
]
;B[rj]
;W[sl]
;B[pg]
;W[pf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move?
 jansteen 3d*:  What is suteshi, denots?
 jansteen 3d*:  Think globally, malf
 jansteen 3d*:  And as severe as possible :)
 WatchOnly NR : n14
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes!
]
;B[mf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  But of course a lot of reading was involved in n14
 jansteen 3d*:  When we play it, it's overplay :)
 WatchOnly NR : not by me :)
 jansteen 3d*:  ok, WatchOnly :)
 jansteen 3d*:  White flows out with a small combination....
]
;W[oh]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Let me check....
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, you're right bugs, it's quarter-final and Chang Hao
 jansteen 3d*:  Sorry :(

;W[lg]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Really Voyager?
 jansteen 3d*:  Next black move is natural
 jansteen 3d*:  ideas?
]
;B[kd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  l16 takes territory and weakens white's group
 jansteen 3d*:  Thanks Voyager
 jansteen 3d*:  0000, b is professional, how can you say that?!
 jansteen 3d*:  o13 doesn't work sulla
 gpan 3k :  jansteen would you move a little  fast?
 jansteen 3d*:  o13 then o14 and ladder comes or capture
 jansteen 3d*:  I will try gpan
 gpan 3k :  thks jansteen
]
;W[nh]
;B[ni]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move is important in close fighting between two weak groups, which ?
 jansteen 3d*:  White h3 is completely out of direction Voyager
 jansteen 3d*:  ok :)
 gpan 3k :  L11
]
;W[rh]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Mutual eye space
 jansteen 3d*:  Chang Hao
]
;B[rd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  next denots?
]
;W[ki]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  You're right denots, but anyway
 jansteen 3d*:  Probably white not happy with the position here
