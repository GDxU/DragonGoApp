C[
 jansteen 3d*: This game is played in the 1p-9p series
]
;W[de]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Ishida Yoshio is maybe the toughest professional on earth to beat in handicap Go
 jansteen 3d*: His reading is awesome and when he's 1 point ahead he will wrap up the game
 jansteen 3d*: Ishida is 46 years of age now
 jansteen 3d*: Black is Jin Guang Zhi
 jansteen 3d*: Black is a 15 years old boy from Korea

;W[ip]C[
 jansteen 3d*: next move? (two options I think)
 cracker 3k*: m6 or g3
 jansteen 3d*: Right cracker
]
;B[gq]C[
 nomad 5d*: g3 only
 jansteen 3d*: Why g3 only nomad?
 nomad 5d*: dunno, just feeling :-)
 jansteen 3d*: I see :-)
]
;W[ln]
;B[jo]
;W[io]C[
 jansteen 3d*: next move?
 nomad 5d*: l6
 cracker 3k*: l6
 jansteen 3d*: right, l6 is tesuji shape here
 jansteen 3d*: however...

;B[hp]C[
 jansteen 3d*: According to Ishida: In handicap game acceptable for black, but in even game it's not
 jansteen 3d*: next move?
 jansteen 3d*: (just big opening move next)
 nomad 5d*: d7 "only" :-)
 jansteen 3d*: Don't trust nomad's "only" (!) :-)
]
;W[nc]
;B[ic]
;W[qf]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Which side to attach now?
 cracker 3k*: q14
 emach 1d*: q14
]
;B[pf]
;W[pg]C[
 jansteen 3d*: reason probably is: black lower right quite solid so black doesn't mind white gets stronger along the right side as well
 jansteen 3d*: Another reason, black doesn't want to weaken his own stone at j17 by attaching at o16
 nomad 5d*: "lean on strong side of opponent"
 jansteen 3d*: right, nomad
]
;B[of]
;W[qe]
;B[qd]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Of course white doesn't follow orders here, where is next?
]
;W[kc]C[
 jansteen 3d*: White makes miai of attacking the j17 stone and stil can slide to q18 later on
 jansteen 3d*: Next black move: strengthen j17 or upper right corner?
 nomad 5d*: p17 only :-)
 jansteen 3d*: right nomad :-)
 jansteen 3d*: Keeping white weak here is *essential*
 jansteen 3d*: However...
]
;B[fc]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Black f17 is too soft, kind of: "not to the point"
]
;W[pb]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Now suddenly the balance of power has shifted here in white's favor

 jansteen 3d*: ok, black strengthened his group at the cost of making white definitely alive

;B[pj]C[
 jansteen 3d*: next move? (just big)
]
;W[dc]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Next black move is very good, shows pro strength
 jansteen 3d*: It stresses white's thinness in the lower right part of the board
 jansteen 3d*: please consider for a moment
 jansteen 3d*: It's not direct, just troublesome for white (feeling, vital point, ...)
 jansteen 3d*: n8 is the right idea, but shape is different
 jansteen 3d*: n7 is sometimes vital point as well
]
;B[ll]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Black can attack upper right starting with s12 for example
 jansteen 3d*: But also lower side looks very thin suddenly
 jansteen 3d*: Ishida was very impressed by this move, it showed pro skill
]
;W[nj]
;B[mn]C[
 jansteen 3d*: n6 was follow-up of m8
]
;W[mm]

;B[ij]C[
 jansteen 3d*: The way things happened the brilliant move at m8 became a burden to black
 jansteen 3d*: There is a thin line betweem success and defeat
]
;W[gk]
;B[ji]
;W[kh]
;B[gi]C[
 jansteen 3d*: While black is occupying dame (invaluable) points, white strengthens both his weak groups
]
;W[lf]
;B[le]
;W[kf]C[
 jansteen 3d*: These two moves show Ishida's skill, they are very vital indeed
 pem 25k*: Should b simply have given up m7 stones?
 jansteen 3d*: Hmm, pem, these are cutting stones, hard to give them away just like that
