 jansteen 3d*: Next?
 Keats 3d : k16
 radar 4d*: k16
 maestro NR : d16?
 cracker 3k*: d16
 fantasia 3d*:  D16
 jansteen 3d*: d16 and k16 are correct direction
 jansteen 3d*: Yet, the move played is different from both, idea?
 brokko 1k*: f16
 jansteen 3d*: right, brokko
]
;B[fd]
;W[df]
;B[jd]C[
 jansteen 3d*: You can consider f16/d14 as kikashi in the opening stages
 jansteen 3d*: It makes white's position flatter, and gives black's position more body
 jansteen 3d*: The extra stone at f16 will also help later on when white would invade around o17-m17 for example
 jansteen 3d*: Next move?
 jansteen 3d*: To phrase differently: Compete building, or invading?
 olli 1d*:  time to invade i should think
 jansteen 3d*: right olli, which points come to mind?
 olli 1d*:  r12 looks attractive
 jansteen 3d*: r12 is not usual here, olli
 jansteen 3d*: r14 is normal
 jansteen 3d*: Considering upper right double wing, the books tell us to invade, right?
 jansteen 3d*: o17 would also be a normal move
]
;W[qc]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Ok, next interesting question: which side to build the wall?
 jansteen 3d*: The rule for blocking is: "the wider side"
 jansteen 3d*: Which side is wider?
 eaj 10k*: what do u mean, wider?
 jansteen 3d*: Wider == larger, more potential
]
;B[qd]
;W[pc]C[
 jansteen 3d*: next move is currently virtual joseki here, which move?
 pem 25k*: "virtual joseki"?
 jansteen 3d*: virtual = almost
 olli 1d*:  o17?
 vono 3d*: O17
 joachim 2k*: o17
 jansteen 3d*: right
]
;B[nc]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Too hard to explain the finesses, but this move is more efficient than p17
]
;W[nb]C[
 jansteen 3d*: White o18 is best response
]
;B[mc]
;W[oc]
;B[od]
;W[mb]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Here another finesse shows, this move is gote
 jansteen 3d*: Gote because when white continues with m17, black will just answer m16 (with good shape)
 jansteen 3d*: next move?
 abcde NR : o4?
 cracker 3k*: n5
 jansteen 3d*: o4 and n5 are right direction
]
;B[mp]C[
 jansteen 3d*: n4 seems a compromise between m3 and n5, interesting move
]
;W[np]
;B[mo]
;W[mq]
;B[kp]
;W[qq]C[
 jansteen 3d*: White's procedure is normal
 jansteen 3d*: Where is big next?
 Keats 3d : k11
 Keats 3d : g13 or k11
 jansteen 3d*: k11 is risky, it would be single-purpose and stake everything on one hand
 hat 8k : c10
 jansteen 3d*: c10 comes very close, try to make c10 more severe, hat
]
;B[ch]C[
 jansteen 3d*: How to deal with this move?
 Keats 3d : jansteen, do u have the kibitzes from the pros ?
 jansteen 3d*: Pro's don't "kibitz", Keats :-)
 jansteen 3d*: Usual approach is pincer around d9
 jansteen 3d*: But then black could invade at c15
 jansteen 3d*: The reason for white's next move is related to this c15 invasion
 jansteen 3d*: Ideas?
 fantasia 3d*:  F14
 jansteen 3d*: fantasia, you're close, try to make it more demanding

 jansteen 3d*: next move?
 Keats 3d : g13
 fantasia 3d*:  F13
 hat 8k :  g13
 jansteen 3d*: g13 and f13 think too big, really
 xray ??? : c6?
 jansteen 3d*: xray, you're in the right direction :-)
 Keats 3d : jansteen: do u have kibitzes from other pros  ??
 jansteen 3d*: Some, Keats
 jansteen 3d*: This is also a normal procedure in such position
 jansteen 3d*: l4 gained efficiency by this sequence
