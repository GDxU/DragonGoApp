 jansteen 3d*:  Three ways to split here: k3, k2 and j5, which one?
 imp NR : i would k5
 imp NR : sorry j5
 jansteen 3d*:  k5> :)
 jansteen 3d*:  yes, good :)

;B[io]
;W[ln]C[
 imp NR : treatens to enclose, and has follow-up to the left
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move also quite usual in this kind of fight, anyone knows?
 jansteen 3d*:  right imp
 imp NR : h4?
 jansteen 3d*:  h4 is more of an emergency when j5 is weaker
 imp NR : then j3
 jansteen 3d*:  g4 asks white to defend f3, don't like it
 jansteen 3d*:  j3 likewise, white already split
 imp NR : hmm...
 imp NR : c3 perhaps?
 jansteen 3d*:  f3 is an option you don't want to loose
 imp NR : or b5?
 jansteen 3d*:  What's the characteristic of this position?
 jansteen 3d*:  "What is going on"?
 jansteen 3d*:  Maximum two words pls :)
 imp NR : m8 normal in the fight...
 imp NR : oh, sorry:)
 imp NR : welcome malf:)
 jansteen 3d*:  "weak groups" is accepted
 jansteen 3d*:  splitting attack? Which two weak groups malf?
 imp NR : j7 also a normal one
 siedler 3d*: hi guys
 imp NR : hi:)
 imp NR : more normal ones i don't know:)
 jansteen 3d*:  When you can not name what's going on it's more difficult to find the corretc move
 imp NR : oh, something like p3 can be thought of...
 jansteen 3d*:  It's like solving problems, when you can clearly define it, half of the work is done
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, in steps:
 jansteen 3d*:  Does white have weak groups?
 imp NR : sure, the m6-ones
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, imp
 jansteen 3d*:  Does black have weak groups?
 imp NR : sure, the j5-ones:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Correct :)
 jansteen 3d*:  So what do we have here?
 imp NR : fight between two weak groups? :)
 jansteen 3d*:  yes, a "running fight" :)
 imp NR : ah:)
 imp NR : so we run:)
 jansteen 3d*:  So when you know it's a running fight you know it's important to get "ahead"
 jansteen 3d*:  Right imp!
 imp NR : j8 instead of j7?
 jansteen 3d*:  panda already had the direction right
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes :)
]
;B[il]C[
 imp NR : panda, what did you say again? :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, k8 very good
 imp NR : ah, thanks:)
 jansteen 3d*:  However, j8 is usual shape
 jansteen 3d*:  k8 leaves cut for white
 imp NR : simple: "running fight", and the correct move pos out:)
 jansteen 3d*:  So what's next?
 imp NR : pops out:)
 jansteen 3d*:  right, which point?
 imp NR : m8 only?
 jansteen 3d*:  (nothing fancy)

;W[ll]
;B[ij]
;W[lj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Now what did black accomplish with these jumps?
 imp NR : weakens d4-h3
 jansteen 3d*:  (remember: black started this attack with k4)
 imp NR : so something like f3 now?
 jansteen 3d*:  (remember: black started this attack with k4)
 jansteen 3d*:  right imp, more?
 imp NR : i feel so stupid tonight:)
 imp NR : i would also like to play on left side
 jansteen 3d*:  Sorry, my network couldn't reach IGS for 3 minutes
 suren 3k*: Hello Jan. How about J16?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, black also glows power over the left edge
 jansteen 3d*:  suren, maybe when black gains more strength j16 would become an option
 imp NR : m12 something?
 jansteen 3d*:  So black wants to combine power over left side with weak white's LL
 suren 3k*: Thx, Jan.
 jansteen 3d*:  Sure
 jansteen 3d*:  It's a trivial move actually, the next one
]
;B[cn]C[
 imp NR : ah, e14 could also be something. Maybe too slow though
 jansteen 3d*:  yes, imp, f14 with attack on left and top becomes an option this way

;W[cl]
;B[en]
;W[fp]
;B[di]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Of course black doesn't jump in the corner in this position

 imp NR : difficult to see if w can cut off the j5 stones
 jansteen 3d*:  White aiming cut aji around k7
 jansteen 3d*:  Now he can I think imp
 imp NR : i wondered before f6
 jansteen 3d*:  He needed f6 to take care of black h5
 imp NR : can imagine that
 siedler 3d*: b e5

 jansteen 3d*:  This game is not very "clear" :)
 jansteen 3d*:  White p7 is related to r3
 imp NR : its clear, but very difficult:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's next move is very big
 jansteen 3d*:  Any candidates?
 imp NR : how that? Just kikashi to me
 jansteen 3d*:  r3-p7 relation?
 imp NR : e14/f14?
 imp NR : yes
 Grandad 6k*: c3?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes imp, that's correct

 jansteen 3d*:  This move sets up the h8 cut
 tim 5k*:  i think B connects @ J6, or plays somewhere else
