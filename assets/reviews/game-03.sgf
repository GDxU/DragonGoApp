 jansteen 3d*: What's the usual move now?
 Xd 2d*: d6
 jansteen 3d*: Right, d6
 madmax 6k*: d6
 jansteen 3d*: Usually (especially with white in upper left) white would play d6 now to avoid black d7
]
;W[qk]C[
 madmax 6k*: also, d6 allows w to b3 later
 jansteen 3d*: Right madmax
]
;B[qm]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Invasion here is normal considering q3 and q16
]
;W[oo]
;B[np]C[
 jansteen 3d*: What's usual now?
 tigerman 1k*:  q8?
 jansteen 3d*: right, q8 is usual
 jansteen 3d*: White's next move I haven't seen before, any ideas?
 pwaldron 2d : m4?
 FDDI 3d : or m4
 jansteen 3d*: m4 is the right idea, but the move played is different shape
 tigerman 1k*: hmm doesn't m4 look like overplay?
 jansteen 3d*: No tigerman, m4 is to induce p6 (see game)

;B[op]C[
 jansteen 3d*: White o2/Black p4 gives good feeling to white
 jansteen 3d*: Next move (normal move here)?
 jansteen 3d*: move protects against l4 cut as well
 Taiji 4d : m7
 Relay 18k : m7
 CIA 2d*: or m7?
 RAMBLE 4k*: m7?
]
;W[lm]C[
 jansteen 3d*: yes :-)

 ago NR :  was d7 better than m3 for sure?
 jansteen 3d*: d7 is keypoint
 jansteen 3d*: keypoint of two moyo's
]
;W[qh]C[
 jansteen 3d*: r12 is important as well, black r11 would be annoying :-)
 jansteen 3d*: r12 also "damages" q16 to some extend
 jansteen 3d*: Next move?
 RAMBLE 4k*: Will b escape or make itself alive?
 jansteen 3d*: RAMBLE, black added a move at o8 and r4, quite safe now
 onyx 4d : seems very good game for w so far
 jansteen 3d*: Yes, onyx, white seems to play a well balanced opening

 dodo 4d : is b J15, w J17 b g16 ok?
 jansteen 3d*: That would have been another game, dodo :-)
 dodo 4d : but still ok?
 jansteen 3d*: But it's hard to use black thickness in this position I think
 dodo 4d : rigth jan. thx.
