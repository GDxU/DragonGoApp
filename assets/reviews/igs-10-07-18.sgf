 jansteen 3d*:  Next move almost obligatory, which one?
]
;B[oo]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Split the white stones, the natural move
]
;W[on]
;B[op]
;W[pm]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move also obligatory, which one?
 jansteen 3d*:  Any suggestions?
 vslo 1k*: r5
 jansteen 3d*:  Black r5 minds territory
 vslo 1k*: or n5
 jansteen 3d*:  In this position black should aim the outside to make q9 and j4 work
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, n5 is correct direction
]
;B[nn]
;W[nm]
;B[mn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black wants to swallow m4 and also aims n7
]
;W[qq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White is satisfied with a base and territory, so takes the corner

;B[rs]C[
 vslo 1k*: kib w w s12?
 jansteen 3d*:  Now white's next: g3, k5, n8, or r14?
 jansteen 3d*:  s12 is second line move?
 jansteen 3d*:  pls choose from g3, k5, n8, or r14?
 vslo 1k*: r14
 jansteen 3d*:  r14 is 5 points from maximum 10 :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, GD, 10 points :)
 vslo 1k*: g3
]
;W[ml]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move works both right side and bottom, a terrific move
]
;B[qn]
;W[pn]
;B[ll]
;W[lk]
;B[kl]
;W[ph]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Now white created similar situation as black's bottom
]
;B[pi]
;W[oh]
;B[nj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black starts a fight since he's strong in the vicinity
]
;W[mj]
;B[ni]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White's p12 need help, next move?
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi colombe
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, difficult
 jansteen 3d*:  All moves in right correction will be marked correct
 vslo 1k*: m13
]
;W[oe]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  m13 is wrong, vslo, that's played from the strong group
 jansteen 3d*:  p14 is correct since it plays from the weak group
 jansteen 3d*:  p15 was played in an attempt to gain tempo to attack o11

 jansteen 3d*:  Now, next question
 jansteen 3d*:  White next at n17, n13, q14 or d10?
 jansteen 3d*:  n13 is 5 points
 jansteen 3d*:  5 points from 10 maximmu
 jansteen 3d*:  We're looking for 100 percent move :)
 vslo 1k*: kib n13
 vslo 1k*: n17
 jansteen 3d*:  Good vslo, 10 points :)
]
;W[mc]C[
 vslo 1k*: thx guessing
 jansteen 3d*:  This move protects the o15 cut, because white will cut back at p16
]
;B[ki]
;W[ik]
;B[ii]
;W[gk]
;B[hl]
;W[hk]
;B[gi]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next question
 jansteen 3d*:  White j16, j13, c14 or e9?
 vslo 1k*: j16
 jansteen 3d*:  j16 correct direction, 8 points
]
;W[ig]
;B[ei]
;W[gg]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Why colombe?
 jansteen 3d*:  White is using his wall this way
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes :) g9 up to m9 :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's ikken tobi's are not a wall :)
 jansteen 3d*:  White can h11 for example
 vslo 1k*: j13 is  is pro move
]
;B[dk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  If white h11 right away black can live locally, so...
]
;W[ql]
;B[qk]
;W[rl]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Now black needs to defend the center
]
;B[jg]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  So white's j13 already gained points (r8 in sente)
 vslo 1k*: k11 cut
]
;W[jf]
;B[kg]
;W[ih]
;B[jh]
;W[if]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  And now still h11 aji
]
;B[hh]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  So white gains here as well (j14 and k14)
]
;W[od]
;B[oc]
;W[eg]
;B[mb]
;W[lb]
;B[nb]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move is big for endgame and treatens o15
]
;W[lh]
;B[li]
;W[qc]
;B[pc]
;W[mf]
;B[kb]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black using l13 stone
 jansteen 3d*:  Now next question
 jansteen 3d*:  White l17, c13, c12 or g8?
 jansteen 3d*:  c12 is useful in relation with f10 and cut
 jansteen 3d*:  c13 is more solid towards the corner
 jansteen 3d*:  I agree, hard to play tenuki there
 jansteen 3d*:  Choice?
 jansteen 3d*:  10 points :)

;B[dh]
;W[cg]
;B[ci]
;W[bi]
;B[cj]
;W[bj]
;B[bk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black defends the aji I just mentioned
]
;W[cl]
;B[ck]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  So white sente to defend defect in top
]
;W[jc]C[
 vslo 1k*: w d4 week
 jansteen 3d*:  Not weak, but no potential, agree
]
;B[cd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black uses his d12 stone which he just played to defend
 jansteen 3d*:  It had also some attacking value, typical pro finesse

;B[fb]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next question
 jansteen 3d*:  White h3, g3, c6 or g16?
 vslo 1k*: g18
 jansteen 3d*:  Good, g16 is only 3 points
 jansteen 3d*:  g3 is 9 points
]
;W[hq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  h3 usually bad, since it strengthens the opponent
 jansteen 3d*:  But in this case the right side is anyway not invadable anymore, so you don't mind
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, colombe, h3 is pro move, quite normal :)
 jansteen 3d*:  h3 is 10 point move
 jansteen 3d*:  Go Seigen often played this kind of move to make the opponent overconcentrated
 jansteen 3d*:  In this case it's just best endgame
]
;B[iq]
;W[ir]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  And now colombe?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes :) Black's next?
 jansteen 3d*:  Standard technique in this shape
 jansteen 3d*:  k2 is the move of course
 vslo 1k*: g3
 jansteen 3d*:  But you need another move first
 jansteen 3d*:  No, simpler than that
 jansteen 3d*:  Just shape
 vslo 1k*: h3
]
