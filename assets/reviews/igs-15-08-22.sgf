 jansteen 3d*:  It surely looks funny to me
 jansteen 3d*:  Any ideas for next move capd?
 jansteen 3d*:  four options: k3, k16, c6 and r6
 colombe 2d*: k3 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  The opening doesn't depend on strength but eye-sight :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Right! k3 would be what most people would play
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi club
 colombe 2d*: hi club, rou rou
 jansteen 3d*:  I'm not kidding direwolf
 jansteen 3d*:  ok :)
 jansteen 3d*:  See, club also proposes k3
 jansteen 3d*:  It's the most visually attractive move
 colombe 2d*: no natural move
 jansteen 3d*:  Splitting white in two
 colombe 2d*: if white plays k3 ...
 colombe 2d*: no more game
 direwolf NR : k3 cannot be right
 jansteen 3d*:  raffa, you can kibitz using the quote character
 jansteen 3d*:  Why not?
 colombe 2d*: k3 cannot be bad
 jansteen 3d*:  Why can't k3 be right?
 direwolf NR : because the two extension are too wide
 direwolf NR : k3 cannot get a good result
 jansteen 3d*:  Both c11 and r11 can take care of themselves (with c14 and r14
 zxh 1d*:  thx jan. little fast?
 jansteen 3d*:  Too fast zxh?
 colombe 2d*: hum, seems that direwolf wants some 'punitions' to night :)))
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, let's pick one from: k3, k16, c6 or r6
 colombe 2d*: direwolf , let's imagine white plays at k3 !
 jansteen 3d*:  The game move is one of them
 direwolf NR : c6
 jansteen 3d*:  The before mentioned Honinbo game continued with f3 by the way
 jansteen 3d*:  Well, direwolf surely has right to be stubborn, you're right in this case :)

 colombe 2d*: i shoul call you now direwolf sensei !
]
;B[ck]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, now important again: white?
 colombe 2d*: but if black loses this game, it because c6 ...
 direwolf NR : c13
 colombe 2d*: e11 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, jump out
]
;W[ei]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Multi-purpose: strengthen oneself, attacking black and helping controling top
 colombe 2d*: cui cui
]
;B[ek]
;W[gi]
;B[gk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Any ideas for next move?
 colombe 2d*: d17 for a peep ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Choose between j11 and invasion of top
 colombe 2d*: just a test
 direwolf NR : k3
 jansteen 3d*:  How do you think black will answer colombe? :)
 colombe 2d*: donno
 colombe 2d*: that why i am curious
 colombe 2d*: depends on black answer, white will choose the direction
 jansteen 3d*:  I think black happily connects with d16 since it removes white's sabaki aji like c15, or b16
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, club
 jansteen 3d*:  So the exchange would weaken white's center
 colombe 2d*: white is already out, not need for sabaki here
 colombe 2d*: j11 is best
 direwolf NR : i repeat, k3
 colombe 2d*: go out in the center cannot be bad
 colombe 2d*: bet, my friend direwolf ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Agree with colombe, j11 can not be bad here
 firefly 1d : g16 feasible?
 jansteen 3d*:  k3 I don't like, looks thin because of e9/g9
 jansteen 3d*:  Kato Masao (9p,B) vs Yoda Norimoto (9p,W)
 colombe 2d*: j11 making miai of invading at the top and j9
 jansteen 3d*:  firefly, you're close
 direwolf NR : but, center looks neutral, w makes double wing
 jansteen 3d*:  g16 doesn't affect black however, locally better move is...
]
;W[gc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This aims at settling quickly with d17, and closing with f15
 jansteen 3d*:  b g16 gives white points and base at the top, hard to play I think
 jansteen 3d*:  That's true, it explains black's next moves
 colombe 2d*: f15
 jansteen 3d*:  He seperates without touching g17
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move I can bet a beer you won't find it
 colombe 2d*: g15 ?
 colombe 2d*: pok i bet
 jansteen 3d*:  sure club, you get 10 choices
 colombe 2d*: i bet a beer with you !
 jansteen 3d*:  wrong
 colombe 2d*: g14
 jansteen 3d*:  w
 jansteen 3d*:  w = wrong

 jansteen 3d*:  no beer
 direwolf NR : black separates?
 jansteen 3d*:  yes
 colombe 2d*: e17 !
 jansteen 3d*:  g14 is wrong club :)
 jansteen 3d*:  wrong
 jansteen 3d*:  colombe has a lot of ideas! :)
 colombe 2d*: ok for a beer, come and see me at the bar
 direwolf NR : g14 is wrong? erk...
 jansteen 3d*:  colombe, you have 8 more chances
 colombe 2d*: no enough :(((
 jansteen 3d*:  club?
 colombe 2d*: e13 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  wrong

;B[hg]C[
 colombe 2d*: e14 ?
 direwolf NR : ok, g13 :)
 colombe 2d*: typo ?
 direwolf NR : other side...
 jansteen 3d*:  no, this is the move
 colombe 2d*: and the pro in the pressroom start to lzugh ?
 colombe 2d*: to laugh ?
 jansteen 3d*:  It was a pretty safe bet :)
 firefly 1d : sort of forcing move
 jansteen 3d*:  This mvoe treatens to cover at h11, so....

;B[fh]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This peep uses e9/g9 (club)
 direwolf NR : peep!?
]
;W[fi]
;B[ic]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  And now black attacks white's intruder
 jansteen 3d*:  Well, it's a lightning game, so the pro's play less inhibited
 direwolf NR : i am confused :)
 colombe 2d*: nori ...
 jansteen 3d*:  Kato Masao (9p,B) vs Yoda Norimoto (9p,W)
 jansteen 3d*:  This shows a glimpse of what they are thinking in those 8 hours/each games :)
 jansteen 3d*:  It's amazing they can play so normal looking games
 colombe 2d*: if playting such moves make  9dp, tomorrow, i will try that against club :)
 direwolf NR : looks like expanding, but...
 jansteen 3d*:  Problem is when we try something funny, pro's roll over from laughing :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, white to escape from enclosure, how?
 colombe 2d*: and white plays where now ?
 direwolf NR : h9
 colombe 2d*: j16
 jansteen 3d*:  It will become pretty normal soon again

 colombe 2d*: cut !
 jansteen 3d*:  Now white is enclosed, but black payed price with some inside peeps )f12 and h12)
]
;W[eb]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move makes white alive
 colombe 2d*: and swallows black base also
 jansteen 3d*:  Since white is alive now suddenly black has the bad aji of k14 cut for example
 jansteen 3d*:  Right colombe
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move?
 colombe 2d*: l12 protect against the cuts but seems bad shape
 direwolf NR : l11
 firefly 1d : l11
 hawi 2k*: L11
 jansteen 3d*:  It's an indirect protection
 colombe 2d*: n15 ?
 hawi 2k*: M12 possible
 jansteen 3d*:  I often mentioned it: ??? is the best defense
 colombe 2d*: j9
]
;B[ik]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  right colombe
 colombe 2d*: haha
 direwolf NR : j9?
 colombe 2d*: i am lucky to night ...
 jansteen 3d*:  This could be considered kind of inducing move: if white jumps, black protects
 jansteen 3d*:  But j9 for jump is pure black profit (j9 useful, jump = dame)
]
;W[dc]C[
 colombe 2d*: pls stop saying that club, i am becoming red !
 hawi 2k*: also of the nature, make the urgent move, so if w jumps, protect becomes urgent

 jansteen 3d*:  direwolf, h3 is on black's wish-list
 jansteen 3d*:  But in Go: oba-yori kyu-ba
 direwolf NR : ok
 hawi 2k*: is L3 a possibility
 jansteen 3d*:  colombe is in great shape
 direwolf NR : comprende
 colombe 2d*: urgent move first ?
 jansteen 3d*:  l3 is soft
 jansteen 3d*:  h3 is locally best
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, oba-yori kyu-ba means: urgent moves before large moves
]
;B[oi]C[
 direwolf NR : :-)
 colombe 2d*: wao, near my proposition
 jansteen 3d*:  Black p11 is simple move: splits and attacks two white groups
 direwolf NR : ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Easy to underestimate such a move
 jansteen 3d*:  Simple in the sense of: no special techniques required
 jansteen 3d*:  We all know p11 kind of move (boshi, cap)
 jansteen 3d*:  This is a perfect example of its application
 direwolf NR : ok, what is difference between p11 and o11?
 colombe 2d*: the difference is not to close to thicness
 colombe 2d*: m11 is stronger thna r11
 direwolf NR : ah, ok, i can accept that
 jansteen 3d*:  p11 has two meanings, it weakens center and attacks r11, o11 wouldn't affect r11 so much
 direwolf NR : ok there too :)
]
;W[kk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  And now direwolf?
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi enrico
 direwolf NR : ? seems you should block the dragon
 jansteen 3d*:  r10 is one way to deal with r11
 hawi 2k*: and Q9?
 jansteen 3d*:  q9 is the other way, good choice hawi

;B[pk]C[
 firefly 1d : p9?
 jansteen 3d*:  Splitting q4 and r11, thus attacking r11 while still aiming (later) l7 cap

 colombe 2d*: o3
 jansteen 3d*:  All moves so far seemed preparation for a severe attack of center white
 direwolf NR : sure,... from where? :)
 jansteen 3d*:  However, my guess is that black's just too weak around o13 to make any attack successful
 hawi 2k*: is L8 a good attack idea?

;B[hq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  tenuki :)
 direwolf NR : woof woof!

 jansteen 3d*:  first is locally best move, enrico :)
 jansteen 3d*:  What, Joe?
 ChickenJoe 4d :  what is better than H3?
 jansteen 3d*:  What i meant was: if you can not find locally best, Go Seigen advises tenuki
 ChickenJoe 4d :  Oh, thx.
 jansteen 3d*:  Sure :)

 jansteen 3d*:  So tenuki is always 2nd best choice

 direwolf NR : he didn't m15?
 hawi 2k*: now N9?
 jansteen 3d*:  no m15
 jansteen 3d*:  no m14
 jansteen 3d*:  m13 is the game
 hawi 2k*: seems keeping attack on left w group is bigger than a few b stones
 jansteen 3d*:  right hawi, but l13 are cutting stones, so they need help
 direwolf NR : w dragon has _got_ to be a problem
 hawi 2k*: are l13 not ok, if o11 cut is defended?
 jansteen 3d*:  n13 cut looks severe hawi
