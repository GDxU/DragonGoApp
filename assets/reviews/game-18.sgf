 jansteen 3d*: In Chinese: Liang Zai Hao (w,9p) vs. Liang Jian (b,3p)
 maestro NR : hi jan!
 jansteen 3d*: Ready for the first move? :-)
 jansteen 3d*: Pls guess it!
 maestro NR : meijin is myung-in in korean
 jansteen 3d*: Hi maestro :-)
 jansteen 3d*: Oh, thanks
 niceguy 3d*: q16:-)
 bhuang NR :  go ahead, jan :-)
 bhuang NR :  k10
]
;B[qf]C[
 bhuang NR :  typo, :-)
 niceguy 3d*: undo pls:-)
 jansteen 3d*: The black player often plays this move, and scores 70% with it!
 maestro NR : this is Yang's trademark move
 Hue 3d : Yang often does this moves.
 jansteen 3d*: Another Korean game record :-)

;W[dd]C[
 bhuang NR :  is Liag Zai Hao 9p?

;B[cn]C[
 maestro NR : c6?
]
;W[qp]
;B[oq]
;W[kp]C[
 bhuang NR :  what an opening!
 jansteen 3d*: Yes, bhuang: In Chinese: Liang Zai Hao (w,9p) vs. Liang Jian (b,3p)
]
;B[mq]C[
 jansteen 3d*: n3 is one of many options here
]
;W[pn]
;B[qr]
;W[qk]
;B[fc]C[
 maestro NR : white doesn't play q3?
]
;W[cf]C[
 niceguy 3d*: It seems Koreans are aiming at smash all theory of Go, from openning to endgame!
 jansteen 3d*: after n3, maestro?
 maestro NR : yes
 jansteen 3d*: Yes, seems natural as well
]
;B[db]
;W[cc]C[
 jansteen 3d*: What is shape now for black?
 levner 10k : k17?
 jmf 1d*: h16?
 niceguy 3d*: h16?
 jansteen 3d*: pls take care of r14 as well, levner
 jansteen 3d*: right
]
;B[hd]C[
 jansteen 3d*: This balances nicely with upper right
 niceguy 3d*: finally we get something fimilar:-)
 bhuang NR :  r14 looks pretty good
]
;W[pc]C[
 jmf 1d*: jan, is this Meijin League?
 jansteen 3d*: I guess so, jmf, but I can't read it
 jansteen 3d*: It is Meijin tournament though
]
;B[qc]C[
 niceguy 3d*: But I think this shape leaves the k17 a excelent point.
]
;W[qb]
;B[qd]C[
 jansteen 3d*: that's true, niceguy
 OneEye 14k*:  where does Jan get all these game records?
]
;W[nc]C[
 jmf 1d*: so now l17 huge?
 jansteen 3d*: This game record was send to us by Keen
 bhuang NR :  m17
 jansteen 3d*: Yes, l17 is enormous
 jansteen 3d*: However, another move as well, where?
 bhuang NR :  r11?
 niceguy 3d*: after k17 j17 k16 move, it looks like play l17 1st and when w k16, play h16, which is a very unreasonable move.
 OneEye 14k*:  s18?
 jansteen 3d*: r11 and s18 are miai I guess
]
;B[dq]C[
 OneEye 14k*:  oops
 jansteen 3d*: In opening: when you don't know what to play, play shimari! :)
]
;W[rb]
;B[ch]C[
 sj 3k*:  tog o off
 maestro NR : s18 seems more valuable than r11
 jansteen 3d*: Black c12 seems to want to induce: c18 --> l17
 bhuang NR :  b has good rhythm
 maestro NR : so k17 now?
 jansteen 3d*: Well, maestro, when black has r11, he can aim n6 next with j4 or r7 follow up
]
;W[qh]C[
 jansteen 3d*: The flow is slightly unnatural to me
]
;B[nf]C[
 maestro NR : i c, thx
 jmf 1d*: i don't like d3
 bhuang NR :  whose flow?
]
;W[cb]C[
 jmf 1d*: I prefer b to settle the top and right first
 jansteen 3d*: Black's flow
 chelly 5k*: this sequence exposes the weaknesses of r14 opening
 jansteen 3d*: I don't like c12
 jansteen 3d*: It was hoping to much I think
 Hue 3d : Agree jansteen.
 jmf 1d*: but it all started at d3, jan
 Hue 3d : It should be r11.
 jansteen 3d*: That's true jmf
 jansteen 3d*: I think so too Hue
 niceguy 3d*: l17 must now
 niceguy 3d*: Otherwise the upper grp too weak.
 bhuang NR :  r11 was my move! :-)
 jansteen 3d*: Agree again niceguy, however...
 jansteen 3d*: r11 instead of c12, bhuang?
]
;B[ol]C[
 OneEye 14k*:  if l17, what about the c12 stone?
 bhuang NR :  instead of d3
 jansteen 3d*: The c12 stone is "light" OneEye, easy to sacrifice
 gogo 3d*:  why this guy alwayse doing this nonse
 jansteen 3d*: I see
 maestro NR : gee, this is a little hard to understand
 jansteen 3d*: Agree maestro
]
;W[pm]
;B[pj]
;W[qj]C[
 sj 3k*:  too hard to predict these two players moves
 jansteen 3d*: Agree, especially the next move
 jmf 1d*: not q12?
 jansteen 3d*: I bet no one will guess it, try?
 Hue 3d : w is predictable, b is not.
 maestro NR : something like l6?
 jansteen 3d*: agree Hue
 bhuang NR :  o6?
 Hue 3d : b is one of new generation.
 niceguy 3d*: n17
 jmf 1d*: k5?
 jansteen 3d*: l6 is right half (bottom)
 moyo 8k*: b is build moyo
 zaphod 5d*: q12 should be normal
 jansteen 3d*: k5 is right quadrant (LL)
 jansteen 3d*: Hi zaphod
 Hue 3d : He is considered one of 4 new leaders in Korean go .
 zaphod 5d*: hi jan
 tromp 3k*:  g3
]
;B[fm]C[
 moyo 8k*: what a fresh move
 jansteen 3d*: This move has to be produced by "feeling", no?
 zaphod 5d*: thats creative, that's what it is
 maestro NR : very entertaining
 OneEye 14k*:  it would be a typo if appear on igs ')
 jansteen 3d*: Yes, very refreshing, moyo, nicely put
 zaphod 5d*: :)
 bhuang NR :  how can we appreciate this move, jan?
 zaphod 5d*: no reason - it's like art
 hml 3d : good move!
 jmf 1d*: I won't even try to understand it, bhuang
 jansteen 3d*: Hmm, I don't know, matter of taste this move I guess :-)
]
;W[hp]
;B[fq]C[
 zaphod 5d*: the more i look at it, the more jealous i am that i would never have found it !
 moyo 8k*: but the sad thing is those player usally will lose the game
 jansteen 3d*: You like it, zaphod?
 bhuang NR :  even with 2 heads? :-)
 hml 3d : i am jealous you can say that, I can't even say that :(
 irs 5k :  I like black's style
 jansteen 3d*: The black player often plays this kind of Go and scores 70% with it, moyo
 zaphod 5d*: i like it - it takes guts to play a move like that
 jmf 1d*: zaphod, what is the difference if b put it at, say e8 or f8 or g8or g7?
 jansteen 3d*: Next move (reducing left side moyo)?
 moyo 8k*: b is younger than 30?
 hml 3d : d11?
 maestro NR : b is either teen or early 20's at most
 irs 5k :  w 2 stones are threatoned
 jansteen 3d*: Yes, moyo, much younger, but don't know how old
 Hue 3d : I think he is about 20.
 zaphod 5d*: e8 would be bad shape, no f7 is an o-geima (big knight)
 jansteen 3d*: Good hml!
]
;W[di]C[
 hml 3d : :)
]
;B[dh]
;W[ei]C[
 zaphod 5d*: that's the standard move for reducing a move like that
 jansteen 3d*: agree zaphod
 jmf 1d*: thx, zaphod. then easier to appreciate f7 now

;B[df]C[
 zaphod 5d*: i would have liked to see d14 right away
 jansteen 3d*: Black is preparing g11 zaphod?
 irs 5k :  btw is anyone using winigc56, my speaker has been silenced since upgrade from 55
 zaphod 5d*: instead of d12 first
 zaphod 5d*: is he?
 jansteen 3d*: I like next move, any ideas?
 zaphod 5d*: f16
 bhuang NR :  b13?
 Hue 3d : b14
 jansteen 3d*: right bhuang!

 zaphod 5d*: that was actually my first instinct
 hml 3d : f13?

 zaphod 5d*: sorry - value judgment
 jansteen 3d*: Sorry to confuse you zaphod :-)

;W[ek]C[
 zaphod 5d*: no, no, i was confused already :)
 irs 5k :  W is now up in the ai:-)
 irs 5k :  air

 jansteen 3d*: yes, it is

 bhuang NR :  you think a shrink would know Go? :-)
 maestro NR : f9?
 jansteen 3d*: Close jmf, but black played different move
 zaphod 5d*: i know one already - but i wouldn't go there - he is crazy
 bhuang NR :  b9
 jmf 1d*: b9?
 jansteen 3d*: putting white into trouble
 irs 5k :  j3

 zaphod 5d*: ouch!
 jansteen 3d*: dunno, sorry :-)

;B[fn]C[
 jmf 1d*: so w forgot to make the exchange at f8 and g7 first.

 irs 5k :  Why not W c10 ?
 zaphod 5d*: g9
 maestro NR : c10 then b can d8, irs
 hml 3d : c7?
]
;B[ho]C[
 jmf 1d*: maybe w f8 first then c9 is ok
 zaphod 5d*: that would have been the next move
 jansteen 3d*: h5 is natural move, splitting the two groups

;W[io]
;B[hn]

 irs 5k :  yes

 qed 17k :  j8
 zaphod 5d*: q12
 jansteen 3d*: right direction

;B[kc]C[
 jansteen 3d*: good, jmf!
 hml 3d : in only w can win this game!
 jmf 1d*: you gave the hint
 jansteen 3d*: Black avoids to give white chances in unclear fighting
 bhuang NR :  l17 was the largest point
 jansteen 3d*: It takes a good listener to understand it though :-)
 jansteen 3d*: So what are white's chances here?
 zaphod 5d*: b j7 would only cut a dead group from an alive one - very different from cutting a life group into 2 dead ones
 jansteen 3d*: How to device a strategy now?
 bhuang NR :  attack q10, p8
 jansteen 3d*: right bhuang!
 gsc 2d*: p14
 jansteen 3d*: so?
 jmf 1d*: p12?
 zaphod 5d*: p12
 hml 3d : jan is a good teacher :)
 jansteen 3d*: q14 slightly too direct
 jmf 1d*: or o12?
 eaj 10k*: p12
 hml 3d : o10?
 jansteen 3d*: right zaphod!

;B[pd]
;W[od]C[
 zaphod 5d*: that also indirectly defends against j7
]
;B[oe]
;W[lc]C[
 jansteen 3d*: White's aim here is to prevent h16 and o14 from linking up
 zaphod 5d*: m16
 jmf 1d*: o16 first?

 zaphod 5d*: right - i saw that only after m16

 jansteen 3d*: Now white has a cut at j16 and m15
 eaj 10k*: there goes b top
 zaphod 5d*: so who will start the ko at o16
 jansteen 3d*: next black move seems a serious mistake
 maestro NR : less than 10 9p in korea, i think
 zaphod 5d*: in that case , i couldn't guess it :)

;B[im]C[
 jansteen 3d*: This move is not to the point
 gameover 1d : just similiar to # of 9p in china, i guess
 zaphod 5d*: but i guessed anyway and i might have played it too
