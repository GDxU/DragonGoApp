 jansteen 3d*:  All pretty noral
 jansteen 3d*:  normal
 guo 3k*:  jan, can u tell me the game is who vs who
 jansteen 3d*:  22nd Gosei title, gm 2: Yuki Satoshi (9p,W) vs. Yoda Norimoto (9p,B)
 guo 3k*:  thx
 jansteen 3d*:  One procedure now is: s5, s4, r14
 jansteen 3d*:  Sure
 jansteen 3d*:  Yasuda sensei once recommended me to play s6 instead of s5
 jansteen 3d*:  This game features this move
]
;W[rn]C[
 dag 5k*: is s6 sente against the corner?  Can black live, if ignores?
 jansteen 3d*:  Now white treatens to create perfect thickness starting with s3
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, black lives as it is, it prepares s3 folowed by q4 in sente though
 jansteen 3d*:  Black prevents this with his next move sequence

;W[mr]
;B[or]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This looks very ugly but black is alive and can aim p6 cutting point now
]
;W[qf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This kakari is very big since it combines well with white's lower-right position
]
;B[nc]C[
 dag 5k*: q11 next?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, where next?
 jansteen 3d*:  q11 would be normal
 guo 3k*:  p 14
 jansteen 3d*:  Very good, guo
 dag 5k*: p15 maybe?
]
;W[of]C[
 guo 3k*:  thx
 jansteen 3d*:  p14 is the more ambituous approach
 jansteen 3d*:  dag, p14 is better shape
 dag 5k*: building large, but looser, framework?
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's next is predictable, ideas?
 dag 5k*: ok
 dag 5k*: somewhere near q10?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, p14 builds efficient looking framework
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, try to predict exact point
 jansteen 3d*:  near q10 is correct
 jansteen 3d*:  remember p6 cut
 dag 5k*: p8?
 jansteen 3d*:  No, near q10 was correct, but look for move which combines nicely with p6 option
 guo 3k*: q9
 dag 5k*: hm... q8 seems to work well for that
 jansteen 3d*:  malf, black has peep at q13, so p-line is acceptable
]
;B[oj]C[
 guo 3k*: by the way, jan, when was the game held, pls
 jansteen 3d*:  Only "one" move now, which one?
 guo 3k*: n10
 jansteen 3d*:  18th of July
 J4 2d*: R10.
 guo 3k*: thx again
 dag 5k*: r10 came to my mind...
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, guo is right again
]
;W[mj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  With this move all white stones "work"
 dag 5k*: had to be that, or r10 -- top or bottom :-)
 guo 3k*: thx for tehe hint
 jansteen 3d*:  answering p10 with r10 is hard, then p10 would be a useful kikashi
 jansteen 3d*:  White should make more territory or power than third line territory
 dag 5k*: right
 jansteen 3d*:  Pls see how black deals with the boshi malf
]
;B[pg]
;W[pf]
;B[nh]C[
 guo 3k*: good shape
 jansteen 3d*:  A simple combination which seperates the white position and gets out

;W[qi]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Now black has two weak groups
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi David, pls help with comments
 dasch 3d*: i try :)
 dag 5k*: right
 jansteen 3d*:  This is too risky for black
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, settling top a little bit
 dag 5k*: so, what if after r16, white q17?
 dasch 3d*: is this a serious game ?
 jansteen 3d*:  This is 22nd Gosei title, 2nd game, David
 dag 5k*: this was a tournament game
 dasch 3d*: oh,thx Jan
 jansteen 3d*:  Then black will play s17 probably, dag
 dag 5k*: ah... ko
 dag 5k*: ah... ok, I mean... not ko
 jansteen 3d*:  :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Bot players settle their groups
 jansteen 3d*:  This is important since it allows them to fight
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's next move anticipates such a fight
]
;B[mg]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This gote move allows white to occupy an O-ba, ideas?
 dag 5k*: c10?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, very good
]
;W[cj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Right David (Saun), O-ba is big point, usually in the opening stages
 jansteen 3d*:  Since black played very solid earlier he can fight now
 jansteen 3d*:  Where to fight?
 jansteen 3d*:  :)
 dag 5k*: cut at p6?
 jansteen 3d*:  We have another David (dasch), so I avoided possible confusion
]
;B[on]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Perfect pupils
 jansteen 3d*:  Suddenly all black stones work well now
 dag 5k*: actually ... three Davids... dag is a David as well :-)
 dag 5k*: hi Davids...
 dasch 3d*: hi David :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Look at g3, p10, o12, and n13, all useful
 J4 2d*: R6?
 jansteen 3d*:  Oh, didn't know that dag, sorry :)
 dag 5k*: q7
 brahms 5k*: Q7 ?
]
;W[pm]
;B[nn]C[
 dag 5k*: s'alright
 jansteen 3d*:  Next white move looks risky but white very much wants to play there
 brahms 5k*: M4 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  m4 would be usual direction, agree
 J4 2d*: O8, right?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, o8 direction is very interesting: seperating black's forces
]
;W[ol]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  How to attack the white bottom now?
 J4 2d*: W cannot endure B connects weak groups.
 dag 5k*: m5?
 brahms 5k*: E10 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  m5 is too soft, n7 too slow :)
 J4 2d*: P8 is better than O8 because P8 is good to right edge, right?
 dag 5k*: l3?
 jansteen 3d*:  p8 is more solid, right

 dag 5k*: now, black tenukis?
 dag 5k*: because living in gote isn't big enough, here?
 dasch 3d*: a big loss for w
 jansteen 3d*:  This result is acceptable for white since there is n1 left as bonus
 jansteen 3d*:  White got a lot of cash this way
 jansteen 3d*:  Destroyed part of corner while capturing three stones, all in sente
 dasch 3d*: but b some more
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, B also territory + thickness
 jansteen 3d*:  Black first defended corner....
]
;B[co]

 jansteen 3d*:  White c7 keeps control over bottom
 jansteen 3d*:  So now black connects p2 group

;B[ls]

;B[ms]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  And white can take last O-ba, ideas?
 dag 5k*: g17
 brahms 5k*: F17 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, g17 right direction, shape wrong though
 jansteen 3d*:  g17 doesn't affect right side position and is terribly weak towards the corner
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, brahms
]
;W[fc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  f17 is nice compromis between e17 (very solid) and g17 (too loose)
 dag 5k*: right
 dag 5k*: I was looking other way... j17, then backing up...
 dag 5k*: didn't back up far enough...
 jansteen 3d*:  Of course black will invade upper-left now, but where?
 dasch 3d*: but now b c 17 anyway
 dag 5k*: hm... black now will invade left?  Maybe b16?
 brahms 5k*: C16 ?
 eagl 3k*: b16?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, malf, b15
]
;B[be]C[
 dag 5k*: how to pick those points?  b15 vs b16 vs c17?
 jansteen 3d*:  This is a traditional invasion point in the d16/f17/c10 configuration
 dag 5k*: I know why not c17... left is clearly bigger than top
 jansteen 3d*:  This point makes miai of c17 and c12
 dag 5k*: ah... ok
 jansteen 3d*:  Good question dag
 jansteen 3d*:  In this case the choice was between c17 and b15
 dag 5k*: the miai answer more helpful than the "traditional" one...
 dag 5k*: lets me work it out next time...
 jansteen 3d*:  c17 is easy to live but inside only, b15 will isolate c10 group, making lower black thickness work
 dag 5k*: c17 lives but white makes wall facing c10 extension.. works well
]
;W[bd]
;B[ce]C[
 dag 5k*: c17 invasion a "thank you" move for white
]
;W[cd]
;B[ch]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Not necessarily dag, c17 is very big territory-wise
 dag 5k*: true...
 jansteen 3d*:  Look, white now made near 15-pnt corner
 dag 5k*: true, but white would have had 15-pt side if black in at c17
 jansteen 3d*:  If black c17, this would have been 5 points black territory, 20 pnt difference
 dag 5k*: and c10 would be strong, not weakened
 jansteen 3d*:  20 points hard to create
 jansteen 3d*:  That's a good point, dag, that's probably the reason why black choose for the outside anyway
 dag 5k*: hm... c17 invasion... who gets sente from it, in this position?
 jansteen 3d*:  besides, no reason yet to be worried about territory here
 jansteen 3d*:  White will get sente after black c17
 dag 5k*: I guess I knew I wanted outside... didn't know how to figure point
 dag 5k*: b15 vs b16 ... now can guess that one
 jansteen 3d*:  22nd Gosei title, gm 2: Yuki Satoshi (9p,W) vs. Yoda Norimoto (9p,B)
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, we go on with the game
 dag 5k*: hm... now white has to do something about c10 group...
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move is predictable, where?
 dag 5k*: thanks
 jansteen 3d*:  Direction of play?
 dag 5k*: e7 or e10, probably e7?
 brahms 5k*: E10, E7 or B11 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  b12 would make black alive, dsaun
]
;W[ej]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  The natural move, strengthening own group, while weakening opponent
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, malf, stay away from thickness
 dag 5k*: b11, now, I think isn't sente... and small?
 jansteen 3d*:  b11 is slow dsaun, and still b13 vital point left, not 100% alive
 jansteen 3d*:  These groups will only make b11 kind of moves in case of ememrgency, players prefer them to use strategically
 jansteen 3d*:  e10 enforces the group and has strategic value as well
 jansteen 3d*:  e10 more useful for attack on n13, or invasion of bottom
 dag 5k*: hm... bottom awful hard to invade... reduce, maybe... but invade?
 jansteen 3d*:  Which move would you have played, malf?
 jansteen 3d*:  Ah, e7 is soft towards the c12 group
 jansteen 3d*:  No follow-up move for e7, e10 has e12 follow-up
 eagl 3k*: h17
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, e7 is amai, soft, sweet
 jansteen 3d*:  dag, when white center strong, then bottom is invadable
 jansteen 3d*:  Think of c3, or f3 kind of moves
 dag 5k*: hm... right... ok... if strong
 jansteen 3d*:  Black now?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, black has to move
 jansteen 3d*:  (with his group)
 jansteen 3d*:  pls choose between e14 and e12
 dag 5k*: hm... rather e14 to e12
 dag 5k*: e12 seems to be playing on dame...
 jansteen 3d*:  Does e14 affect white's position?
 dag 5k*: whereae e14 will (a little) reduce white's top territory
 Grandad 6k*: e12 d13
]
;B[eh]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  e14 doesn't affect the top, so feels uncomfortable to play there
 jansteen 3d*:  Black is still pushing white towards black's thickness
 jansteen 3d*:  Next white normal as well
]
;W[em]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move prevents: d9, d10, b8 combination
 jansteen 3d*:  All groups are more or less stabalized now, so endgame starts
 jansteen 3d*:  Black takes first large endgame point, which one?
 dag 5k*: h17?
 jansteen 3d*:  Very good
]
;B[hc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  pls note that h17 indirectly also helps e12 group
 jansteen 3d*:  This explains white's strategy in the following sequence
]
;W[kd]C[
 somanyfish NR : f14?
 jansteen 3d*:  Now black has to choose: m17 (helps n13), or k17 (helps h17 and e12)

;B[id]
;W[he]
;B[gc]

]
;B[bi]C[
 brahms 5k*: E14 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Good!
 dag 5k*: ah right... now is desperate, run away has been cutoff, so live

]
;B[bp]

 jansteen 3d*:  Like it?
 dag 5k*: hm.. is nice... grows territory for white...
 jansteen 3d*:  Pros can always find such impressive looking moves
 dag 5k*: but isn't something near r9 getting big?
 jansteen 3d*:  How much is r9 worth?
 jansteen 3d*:  If black plays, he can r10
 dag 5k*: hm... 8-10 pts, maybe?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, maybe less, because white will q11 in sente and can cut off q13 cleanly
 jansteen 3d*:  Dsaun, there are no 15 points between r11 and r6, so should be less
