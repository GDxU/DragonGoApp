 colombe 2d*: thx malf
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, title set, board cleaned, observers ready?
 jansteen 3d*:  The score up to this game is 1-1, this game is very important for outcome
 jansteen 3d*:  The Gosei is best of 5, so this might be key game
 zli 7k : Pro teachers onIGS, see : help jansteen
 jansteen 3d*:  imp is not here :(

 zli 7k : just kidding
 colombe 2d*: HomePro, we know eachother ?
 iota 20k : see help I've fallen and I can't get up
 jansteen 3d*:  The interesting thing about this match is that....
 jansteen 3d*:  Yoda plays very normal and Yuki tends to experiment a lot
 colombe 2d*: oh.... club !!!
 jansteen 3d*:  The latter likes to fight, the first likes solid games
 colombe 2d*: club sensei here :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Ah, HomePro == club == zion? :)
]
;W[pb]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move?
 colombe 2d*: n4
 colombe 2d*: n4 is pro
 jansteen 3d*:  Why all of you want to m17? :)
 colombe 2d*: or d10
 jansteen 3d*:  k4 is more like it :)
 jansteen 3d*:  oh really, m17 is played in this shape?
 jansteen 3d*:  panda also close
 jansteen 3d*:  Game is compromise between k4 and f3
]
;B[iq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Yuki can play unusual moves
]

 jansteen 3d*:  What's follow-up of j3 (next move)?

 jansteen 3d*:  yes

 imp NR : hi, just in time i see:)
 iota 20k : Malf, I presume they mean r17 is no good unless you're a 9p
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi imp!
 colombe 2d*: hoi !
 jansteen 3d*:  Black to improve the quality of his moyo
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 craig 7k*: n16
 imp NR : o4
 mmarc 3k*: p4
 jansteen 3d*:  o4 is closest so far
 jansteen 3d*:  yes mmarc!
]
;B[op]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  mmarc has good feeling
 mmarc 3k*: no feeling, just luck
 iota 20k : but it does support the corner nicely
 jansteen 3d*:  p4 works both ways, bottom and right side
 mmarc 3k*: and help j
 mmarc 3k*: j3
 colombe 2d*: white to nvade
 jansteen 3d*:  White to split c6/d10 group, how?
 mmarc 3k*: c8
 jansteen 3d*:  No PURPLE, the whole group
 jansteen 3d*:  Not the two stones from each other
 craig 7k*: white need higher
 jansteen 3d*:  Right panda, isolate the whole group
 imp NR : e6?
 mmarc 3k*: e6
 jansteen 3d*:  e6 is closest so far, but not good shape
 colombe 2d*: f5
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, f5 is normal shape
 nameless 3k*:  n14
 jansteen 3d*:  Now improve on f5
 imp NR : f5 very loose
 cm 17k :  E8?
 mmarc 3k*: f6
 jansteen 3d*:  Make f5 work better by exchanging a move first
 imp NR : f6 also possible...
 craig 7k*: h4, f5
 colombe 2d*: d6
]
;W[co]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Good, sad!
 jansteen 3d*:  And good panda!
]
;B[dn]
;W[fo]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  It's all very simple actually
 imp NR : hmm...
 colombe 2d*: J5 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  White's c5/d6 exchange makes white c12 work harder
 jansteen 3d*:  f5 attacks left side and prepares invasion around m4
 jansteen 3d*:  Right karui, c12 peeps into black's territory/base
 imp NR : b10 now?
 jansteen 3d*:  To defend black c10 would be normal shape, but feels miserable
 colombe 2d*: j5 ?

 zli 7k : b6
]
;W[gn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black played f6 with an idea in his mind....
]
;B[go]C[
 imp NR : interesting:)
 jansteen 3d*:  However, usually the first one to start a fight is not happy with his position
 jansteen 3d*:  But then again, Yuki likes to fight, so maybe still all ok :)

 jansteen 3d*:  Right Jmm, so black likes to fight in lower-right, but not in lower-left :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Result of this fight is hard to evaluate for me
 jansteen 3d*:  very good AtWork
]
;B[in]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  b10 is small now malf, since it doesn't affect black's group
 jansteen 3d*:  White's next move?
 jansteen 3d*:  Black has still c3 aji
 Grandad 6k*: q10?
 mmarc 3k*: g9
 jansteen 3d*:  I guess no one will guess it :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Let me try to hint
 jansteen 3d*:  Should white walk with g7?

 jansteen 3d*:  White p9 makes the last few black stones seem not working
 jansteen 3d*:  j6 and m5 don't do a lot right now
 jansteen 3d*:  So black thinks: "how to make them do more work?"
]
;B[di]
;W[dh]
;B[eh]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  By starting a fight in front of this wall :)
 jansteen 3d*:  q11 doesn't defend a lot panda, r17 can slide in

 jansteen 3d*:  Good feeling, nameless
 jansteen 3d*:  yes, imp, good
 jansteen 3d*:  Now the reasonable version :)
 jansteen 3d*:  j13 can be cut
 jansteen 3d*:  Good panda

;W[ih]C[
 imp NR : :)
 jansteen 3d*:  White in a sense taking over the attack
 imp NR : imp is bad at ladders:)
 jansteen 3d*:  imp always goes all-out, imp is like Sakata :)
 mmarc 3k*: d17
]
;B[jd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  So now white center can take care of itself and white has time for LR
 jansteen 3d*:  Ideas for white in lower-right (highlight of this game)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, basically r8 is correct
 imp NR : still like r4
 jansteen 3d*:  White played some kikashi first though
 jansteen 3d*:  Right imp, like r4
