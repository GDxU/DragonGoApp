 imp NR : nog geen toeschouwers...
 jansteen 3d*:  This match is between two young and promising players from Japan and China
 jansteen 3d*:  Ik heb even rondgeschreeuw, kijken of dat help
]
;B[qo]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Gisteren heb ik de derde (en beslissende) partij nagespeeld
 jansteen 3d*:  Vandaag de 1ste partij
]
;W[jq]
;B[cf]C[
 imp NR : hi malf:)
 jansteen 3d*:  no problem with the dutch malf? :)
]
;W[ch]
;B[cn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  The left side pattern is popular these days
 jansteen 3d*:  Kobayashi Satoru started using it against Cho Chikun in the Kisei matches
 jansteen 3d*:  Instead of approaching the ni-rensei from the outside black comes in from the inside first
]
;W[fp]
;B[bp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Now there is a basic good move available for white, which one and why?
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi Girl, 5d*!
 imp NR : c8?
 jansteen 3d*:  c3 serves one purpose: territory
 imp NR : to help c12
 jansteen 3d*:  Try to find one with at least two meanings
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes imp, and why?
 imp NR : c8 helps c12, and takes influence
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, c8 or c9 is mutual point for a base
 jansteen 3d*:  White can take the initiative on the left side by attacking black's group
 jansteen 3d*:  When you get nothing in return, that's right malf
 CWine 2d :  What better way to attack than to deny a base with c3?
 jansteen 3d*:  But it's always a trade
 jansteen 3d*:  CWine, when white c3, then black c9
 jansteen 3d*:  Instead of c8 white played the modern version....
 CWine 2d :  Yes, and in a simple view, miai.

;W[bn]
;B[co]
;W[dq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Please note that the territorial loss is not dramatic, and c14 looks all the weaker now
 jansteen 3d*:  An interesting way of playing
]
;B[bo]
;W[fd]C[
 CWine 2d :  One, greedy thought, for B, is M3, looking at H3 or M5.
 jansteen 3d*:  Where are the big points now (there are four of them)
 jansteen 3d*:  Right CW, m3 is one of them
 jansteen 3d*:  right, k17 direction is the other one
 jansteen 3d*:  two more...
 imp NR : c17?
 jansteen 3d*:  hmm, c17 big but not top priority
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, q10 is big
 jansteen 3d*:  One more move is very nice to take
 imp NR : c10 overplay?
 jansteen 3d*:  Black c10 would induce the move which white wants to play anyway
 imp NR : otherwise d8 perhaps?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes imp!
 jansteen 3d*:  white d8 expands the left side and has e7 follow-up, very big
 CWine 2d :  Either direction from Q16, at first glance, look like miai.
 jansteen 3d*:  So now we can udnerstand the game....

;B[lq]
;W[dl]
;B[pj]
;W[nc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Both players got two big points this way
]
;B[pf]
;W[pb]
;B[qc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move is interesting :)
 jansteen 3d*:  It's not the usual l17
 jansteen 3d*:  Nor is it m16 (bad in this case)
 jansteen 3d*:  But what then?!
 imp NR : strange, i would have ommitted r17 so not to provoke l17:)
]
;W[lc]C[
 imp NR : because b plays c17 now?
 jansteen 3d*:  Pro's get more solid every day :)
 imp NR : and w wants to be far away from the wall?
 jansteen 3d*:  Might be imp, also black's usual forcing sequence starting with m16 is gone
]
;B[cc]
;W[cd]
;B[bd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move?
 jansteen 3d*:  dasch?
 imp NR : d17 (Renee), b15 (Henk) :)
 jansteen 3d*:  How about Kirsten?
 CWine 2d :  Not right now, but isn't B concerned about lower left safety?
 imp NR : Kirsten also d17
]
;W[be]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  b15 wins
 imp NR : you are not going to tell they are right i hope:)
 jansteen 3d*:  White's left side is high, white's top is low (m17)
]
;B[bb]
;W[ad]
;B[bc]
;W[ce]
;B[fb]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This joseki is rare for pros, it's very thin
 jansteen 3d*:  Usual is b18 at b17, and f18 at e18
]
;W[jo]
;B[lo]
;W[em]C[
 dasch 3d*: seems to me b far ahead
 jansteen 3d*:  Both players perfectionating their moyo
 imp NR : pro's are smart in reducing moyo's
 CWine 2d :  If B feels he can leave left corners, slam a stone down on K10.
 jansteen 3d*:  When facing a moyo you have three choices...
 jansteen 3d*:  You have moyo yourself and look for the border between yours and opponents and play there
 jansteen 3d*:  You invade opponents moyo
 CWine 2d :  Invade, reduce, or resigh?
 jansteen 3d*:  You reduce opponents moyo
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, your choice in this case....? :)
 imp NR : combine reducing and building up your own moyo
 jansteen 3d*:  Which corner point, malf?
 jansteen 3d*:  So which point imp?
 jansteen 3d*:  Ah, right malf, those are the most valuable ones usually
 imp NR : around l7
 jansteen 3d*:  That's correct, around l7 was played
]
;B[jn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  imp has help tonight :)
 dasch 3d*: now w fights with l6?
 imp NR : bet you I do:)
 jansteen 3d*:  So, now white faces the same choice (out of three), which one shall it be?
 jansteen 3d*:  dasch, you're right about white taking action
 CWine 2d :  Right side open enough for invasion.
 imp NR : Reducing (Renee)
 imp NR : invade (Henk)
 jansteen 3d*:  Henk is correct again
 jansteen 3d*:  Now question is: where to invade?
 imp NR : q6? or r8
]
;W[ql]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Henk unbeatable tonight :)
]
;B[qj]
;W[qn]
;B[po]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  malf, about your suggestion (o14):
 dasch 3d*: tough game now for w
 jansteen 3d*:  o14 only prevents black from building, it doesn't build a lot for white
 imp NR : p8 now (Renee)
]
;W[ro]
;B[rp]
;W[rm]
;B[rk]
;W[pn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black doesn't see any profit from attacking more right now
 jansteen 3d*:  profit coming
 jansteen 3d*:  So he plays follow-up of k6
]
;B[io]
;W[jp]
;B[kn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Note that this weakens white's group from a distance
]
;W[oo]
;B[so]
;W[ok]
;B[rn]
;W[nm]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Now white has some sort of sabaki
 CWine 2d :  B wants to punish W for not answering K6. Can W go back to that area?
 jansteen 3d*:  Black to play, anything interesting in the bottom?
 russell 5k*: sabaki is the japanese term for "flexible shape"
 jansteen 3d*:  good CW, any ideas?
 russell 5k*: h3
 russell 5k*: h3 then h4 or j4?
 jansteen 3d*:  This is all high-level reading, the move played was...
]
;B[gp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  In a sense logical: leaning attack of k3
 mingzhong 1k*:  m17 typo?
 jansteen 3d*:  No mingzhong, new move
]
;W[hp]
;B[go]
;W[gq]
;B[hq]
;W[hr]C[
 mingzhong 1k*:  intresting
]
;B[fq]
;W[gr]C[
 russell 5k*: they are around the same
 russell 5k*: but maybe it would be harder for h3 to work
 jansteen 3d*:  Black strengthened his foothold here
 russell 5k*: and w is not alive yet, right malf?
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move makes sense considering this additional strength
 CWine 2d :  Assume outcome here is neutralization, B sente, where?
 imp NR : g7?
]
;B[ni]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black pushing white along black's forces
 jansteen 3d*:  At the same time enlarging UR corner
 russell 5k*: does this give black a lot of territory?
]
;W[mk]
;B[qb]C[
 russell 5k*: it weakens the position of his l5 wall
 jansteen 3d*:  This is typical moment to count a game
 jansteen 3d*:  But since it's late we skip that :)
 imp NR : g18 big

;B[am]C[
 russell 5k*: was that really worth gote?
 jansteen 3d*:  Very good imp!
 russell 5k*: wh didn't b c2 instead?
 imp NR : all here vote for g17 now!
]
;W[gb]C[
 imp NR : sorry g18
]
;B[eb]
;W[gc]C[
 russell 5k*: wow, that was good
 jansteen 3d*:  This move big since black had a nasty invasion at k17
 russell 5k*: but w is still not on left side, b could invade
 jansteen 3d*:  Since invasion is off now black takes the other option: reduce
 dasch 3d*: seems b r 18 was too slow?
 imp NR : two left here, one fell asleep:)
 jansteen 3d*:  I agree dasch, too much concerned with territory
 jansteen 3d*:  :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Too boring the game? :)

 jansteen 3d*:  which cut? :)
 imp NR : h13
]
;W[gg]
;B[jd]
;W[jc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move can only be understood when counting
 jansteen 3d*:  (this is a typical counting game)
 jansteen 3d*:  But we skip the counting as promised

;W[hh]
;B[hi]
;W[ii]
;B[ij]C[
 dasch 3d*: looks good to me without counting :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Agree :)
 imp NR : agree with dasch, seems normal move
 jansteen 3d*:  White's next move is severe, ideas?
 imp NR : cut (h10)
 CWine 2d :  M14
 jansteen 3d*:  Well, about g11, if black clearly ahead he would play conservative with g8 for example
 dasch 3d*: cut at h 10(IGS-style)
]
;W[hj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, white played IGS style
 russell 5k*: g10 atari?
 jansteen 3d*:  Pls note that white is aiming to move the n14 cutting stone so black has to be careful
