;W[cd]C[
 jansteen 3d*: This is the missing game in the series so far
 eaj 10k*: hi all
 jansteen 3d*: All other games have been replayed before on IGS
 sunday 2d*: jansteen u probably mistyped w's name? :)
 jansteen 3d*: The games are stored on my WWW pages somewhere :-)
 jansteen 3d*: Ok, let's correct in Sunday
 jansteen 3d*: Any suggestion for correction?
 sunday 2d*: who is xian xian zhen su?
 eaj 10k*: first question from jan :)
 sunday 2d*: maybe wu gong zhen su?
 LingHuCong 3d*: xiao
 jansteen 3d*: In japanese: "Ogata Masaki"
 jansteen 3d*: Not Takemiya
 LingHuCong 3d*: it is 8p?
 jansteen 3d*: No, 9p
 LingHuCong 3d*: or 9p? now
 sunday 2d*: hmm i don't remember another zhen su :)
 jansteen 3d*: "o" = xiao (small)
 jansteen 3d*: "gata" = prefecture
 LingHuCong 3d*: in Lei Tai match Xiao Xian is 8p
 jansteen 3d*: "masa" = truth
 jansteen 3d*: "ki" = tree
 sunday 2d*: Oh i c
 jansteen 3d*: Then it's correct?
 eaj 10k*: tree of truth from the small prefecture?
 sunday 2d*: I thought he was 6p :)
 sunday 2d*: didn't even think of him :)
 LingHuCong 3d*: who is another player?
 jansteen 3d*: Ok, we start :-)
 eaj 10k*: i wish i had a name like that!
 water 4d : q4

;B[pq]C[
 water 4d : oops
 eaj 10k*: q5
 water 4d : r5 or f7
 sunday 2d*: q5
 jansteen 3d*: This game shows that 1p and 9p can fight on comparable hights
]
;W[qo]C[
 sunday 2d*: f7 would be impressive :)
 eaj 10k*: f7??!
 jansteen 3d*: Black showed a very positive attitude in this game
 LingHuCong 3d*: f7?

;B[pm]C[
 sunday 2d*: water said so

 jansteen 3d*: You know this joseki right?
 eaj 10k*: umm.. no, but that's ok
 sunday 2d*: gee to strange
 jansteen 3d*: m5 is intended to gain tempo to develop the corner group
 jmf 1d*: who is w? Chinese name plz

;B[no]
;W[on]C[
 jansteen 3d*: In Chinese: Xiao Xian Zhen Shu (w,9p) vs. Shan Tian Ta Zi (b,1p)
 LingHuCong 3d*: n6
 water 4d : n6
 jansteen 3d*: right!
 LingHuCong 3d*: may be r4
 Spirit 30k : hi
 sunday 2d*: LingHuCong not confident enough
 sunday 2d*: :)
 Bridge81 NR : Ta or Tai ?
 LingHuCong 3d*: who is b?
 jansteen 3d*: The reason of n6 (kosumi) instead of o6 (traditional better shape) is that o6 would "kill" own q7 stone too much
 Watson 12k*: is this a new joseki?
 jansteen 3d*: without affecting the m5 stone a lot
 jansteen 3d*: No Watson, quite usual
 sunday 2d*: n6 doesn't affect m5 too much either
]
;B[mn]C[
 jansteen 3d*: It does have the m6 follow-up later, sunday

;W[qq]C[
 Watson 12k*: how many games are we doint today?

 sunday 2d*: why b has to move around here anyway? i would go to corner

;W[pp]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Allow o6 enclosure, sunday?
]
;B[oq]
;W[rq]C[
 sunday 2d*: true, then n6 fight?
 LingHuCong 3d*: j4
 sunday 2d*: maybe in corner move p4 or the like
 jansteen 3d*: Maybe that is joseki as well, have to check later if it has been played before
 LingHuCong 3d*: m3/
 sunday 2d*: huh p4 not good

;B[lq]C[
 LingHuCong 3d*: now 1p!

 hrb 3d*: mini Chinese, :)
 jansteen 3d*: next big move for black?
 angus 7k*:  that sounds like a monty python ruotine!
 hq 1d*: d10 now?
 Watson 12k*: d10
 jansteen 3d*: Big Chinese would be o17 on q16
 LingHuCong 3d*: o17 be q16
 LingHuCong 3d*: then big low chinese
 jansteen 3d*: right d10 is correct
 eaj 10k*: thanks
 eaj 10k*: watson is good!
 jansteen 3d*: d10 is key in this position, taking this is most important

 LingHuCong 3d*: c5 or e6
 LingHuCong 3d*: d7?
 hq 1d*: hard to guess here, b5?
 jansteen 3d*: c8, then white invades (3,3) and c11 will become redundant
 LingHuCong 3d*: g4?
 Watson 12k*: d7 depeds on laddar
 jansteen 3d*: b5 is the right idea, hq
 water 4d : e6

 gumby 30k : whats the URL?

 Watson 12k*: what is the homepage?
