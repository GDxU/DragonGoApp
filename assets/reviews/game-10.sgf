C[
 jansteen 3d*: This game is Wang Wi 1995: Cho Hunhyun b,9p) vs. Choi Kyu Byung (w,7p)
 jansteen 3d*: In Chinese: "Cao Xun Xuan" vs "Cui Gui Bing"
 jansteen 3d*: Wang Wi translates as: "Seat of the King"
 jansteen 3d*: The Wang Wi title is Korean's 2nd most prestigeous title.
 jansteen 3d*: This game is very exciting to replay.
 jansteen 3d*: In my opinion it can be considered as a "modern classic".
 us 3d*: Choi Kyu Byung became pro. at age 12, but he had left Go for 12yrs. for study.
 us 3d*: That's why he is still 7p.
 jansteen 3d*: Really, now he's full-time pro?
 maestro NR : yes jan
 jansteen 3d*: I see, thanks guys
 maestro NR : he is playing very well these days

 bj1 1k*:  o17 also ok
 jansteen 3d*: Probably bj1, although black could go for a moyo with q10 then.
 jansteen 3d*: The moyo would not be of top quality though because of f3/j3 shape.
 jansteen 3d*: Which side to play tsume now (r8 or r12)?
 brokko 1k*: r8
 jansteen 3d*: right again Rob

 cracker 3k*: why s2?
 jansteen 3d*: good question cracker, let us think.
 jansteen 3d*: s2 is yosumi
 jansteen 3d*: when white answers t2, t5 is an eye.
 jansteen 3d*: when white answered like this, it is seki later on, right?
 niceguy 3d*: t5 half sente.
 jansteen 3d*: right, t5 half sente :-)

 shou 13k*: but now w can k3
 jansteen 3d*: k3 is risky shou
 jansteen 3d*: it doesn't affect black, so you will be attacked with j6.

 cracker 3k*: j16?

 jansteen 3d*: j16 instead would leave a weakness at h17 and g17 cracker
 jansteen 3d*: next move is "pro likes territory" move :-) Where?
 bj1 1k*:  k17/k7?
 jansteen 3d*: k7 is not the right way to attack bj1, white would escape with h5
 bj1 1k*:  d8?
 jansteen 3d*: close, bj1
 us 3d*: c18, or d9

 jansteen 3d*: White p6 is quite something
]
;B[qh]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Black is also being positive
 jansteen 3d*: They play too complicated for me :-)
]
;W[ph]C[
 jansteen 3d*: r12 sets up s10 and wants to see that white will respond
 jansteen 3d*: Later white's choice might have been wrong or ineffective
 jansteen 3d*: That's the point of asking a reply in an early stage, without full information

 jansteen 3d*: ' This settles it, another ko
 jansteen 3d*: So white finally resigned this heroic battle
 jansteen 3d*: A great game this, modern master piece
 jansteen 3d*: White missed a good combination at the right side
 jansteen 3d*: I leave it to you to find it
 jansteen 3d*: It's at move 200 or 202
 jansteen 3d*: You already mentioned: "what's white doing", well, try to figure it out yourself, ok? :-)
 jansteen 3d*: So: find the right way to play for white at 200
 jansteen 3d*: (Also 202 can still play the combination).
 jansteen 3d*: Please study it, ok?
 jansteen 3d*: Thanks guys, it was very interesting again
