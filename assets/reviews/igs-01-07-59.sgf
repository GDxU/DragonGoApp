 imp NR : hi
 imp NR : oeps, nog geen titel, dan ben ik er nog even uit:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Reconnect imp, just set the title :)

;B[pq]
;W[dp]C[
 imp NR : wow, een boel:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Title set now, imp?
 imp NR : sure
 jansteen 3d*:  ok :)
]
;B[qo]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  ok :)
 imp NR : hpelijk valt het mee
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move we saw before in a previous game we studied, ideas?
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi direwofl
 imp NR : hi:)
 imp NR : i will shut up for a moment
 jansteen 3d*:  Remember imp when I asked you to think about inspired move?
 imp NR : (I saw that game) :)
 imp NR : sure, that's why:)
 jansteen 3d*:  ok, you remember :)
 jansteen 3d*:  others any creative ideas in this position?
 jansteen 3d*:  No? ok.... imp?
 imp NR : q6 maybe? :)
]
;W[pn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Right :)
 jansteen 3d*:  q6 flattens black's right side, and works nicely with white's left side hoshi stones
]
;B[fq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Pro's like tenuki to try to get on top of their opponent
 jansteen 3d*:  It's very well possible that depending on white's anser black will choose between r6 or q5
]
;W[hq]
;B[cn]
;W[fp]C[
 imp NR : q5 right away possible?
 imp NR : instead of w h3?
 jansteen 3d*:  q5 for black you mean imp?
 jansteen 3d*:  Oh, I see, yes
 imp NR : instead of white h3
 jansteen 3d*:  Black will q4 and take sente to play c6 as well I guess
 imp NR : q5-q4, r6-s5, then h3?
 imp NR : hi shouzhuo:)
 jansteen 3d*:  In that case white's heavy imp, so black could then attack white with q9
 jansteen 3d*:  But I guess it's possible anyway :)
 imp NR : ok, isee, thx:)
 jansteen 3d*:  hi shouzhuo, yes, another Tokyo Cup game
 jansteen 3d*:  White f4 triggers joseki
]
;B[gp]
;W[gq]
;B[cp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Here white has two moves: c3 and the move played in the game
 jansteen 3d*:  c3 leads to a very interesting variation, maybe we encounter it in some other game someday
 imp NR : c3? i thought e3 only?
 jansteen 3d*:  What's the other joseki move?
 imp NR : hope so jan:)
 jansteen 3d*:  right, e3: grab the cutting stone
]
;W[eq]
;B[cq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Result: black the corner, white thickness
 jansteen 3d*:  What joseki books never mention are the follow-up moves in joseki shapes
 jansteen 3d*:  Especially in this shape you should be familiar with the possible continuations
 jansteen 3d*:  But also, maybe later in this game
 jansteen 3d*:  White plays elsewhere, suggestions?
 jansteen 3d*:  Ah, shouzhuo already got it
]
;W[nc]
;B[qf]
;W[pb]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, he's 9p now, probably promoted this year
 imp NR : jans has a bad connection:(
 jansteen 3d*:  Did my kibitzes reach IGS?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right Shouzhuo
 jansteen 3d*:  Thanks direwolf
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, again black doesn't answer white immediately but continues in LL corner
 jansteen 3d*:  ok, I wait
 imp NR : interesting story
 jansteen 3d*:  That's quite unusual isn't it?
 jansteen 3d*:  es, interesting, thanks!
 imp NR : can he compete in the future for a title, you think?
 imp NR : ic, thx
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, the game... :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Black continued LL, suggestions?
 evan 4k*: apparently not...
 jansteen 3d*:  LL, shouzhuo :)
 evan 4k*: doesn't LL seem finished?
 imp NR : f2?
 jansteen 3d*:  No evan, LL has various follow-up moves, in this case black decides to continue
 imp NR : same here:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Right shouzhuo!
]
;B[fr]C[
 evan 4k*: yeah, guess f2 makes sense
]
;W[er]
;B[fo]
;W[ep]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This is one option for black
 jansteen 3d*:  Just don't play this without thinking: it costs points
 imp NR : are there any other interesting follow-ups besides f2 and e2?
 jansteen 3d*:  But it gives black some stones on the outside (black also has h4, j4 left for example
 jansteen 3d*:  Not for black, imp
 jansteen 3d*:  right
]
;B[qc]
;W[kc]
;B[cf]
;W[fd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black f5 indicated center-oriented game so nxt move is suprise
 imp NR : b16 now seems unattractive, c17 not consistent with LL?
 evan 4k*: h17?
 imp NR : but bet on c17
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, black plunged in at c17
 jansteen 3d*:  Good imp!
]
;B[cc]
;W[cd]
;B[bd]C[
 imp NR : otherwise w upper side too large
 jansteen 3d*:  Here white should think about d17 or b15, which one in this case?
 imp NR : d17 to take sente for LR
 jansteen 3d*:  shouzhuo?
 jansteen 3d*:  Guess he's busy
 jansteen 3d*:  martin won this round
]
;W[be]
;B[bc]
;W[ce]
;B[eb]C[
 imp NR : hhmm, good martin:)
]
;W[fb]
;B[ec]
;W[fc]
;B[ed]C[
 imp NR : can you explain jan? (Or only after the act? :) Or are both possible here?
]
;W[ee]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Well, "can explain" is too strongly put, but if black can not use f5 stone, f2 will be a loss
 jansteen 3d*:  So in a sense f2 might have been wrongly timed
 imp NR : would you guess both possible?
 jansteen 3d*:  But happy to hear other suggestions from you guys :)
 jansteen 3d*:  btw, upper-left needs one more move to live unconditionally
 jansteen 3d*:  no problem, shouzhuo
]
;B[dc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, that's also played often, the black cut at f15
]
;W[df]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move (big point) ?
 peaced 15k :  Hi, r y play with y self?
 jansteen 3d*:  Relax peaced :) We are studying a game which I replay
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, white thick
 imp NR : hmm, difficult to play in LR now, that helps w center
 jansteen 3d*:  k16 might be a little too nervous
 imp NR : around d10?
 jansteen 3d*:  c12 is (much) too close to white's thickness
 jansteen 3d*:  How about just flatten it shouzhuo with m16/o16?
 imp NR : or maybe m16/o16 combination
 jansteen 3d*:  Around d10 is another suggestion
 jansteen 3d*:  We think similar imp :)
 imp NR : just c9 then
 jansteen 3d*:  But then the fight would be more interesting for black, shouzhuo?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, that's true
 imp NR : well, f15 cut may help b?
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, upper-right for later, black played left side
 jansteen 3d*:  Choose between c9/c10 or d10
 jansteen 3d*:  Right
]
;B[dj]C[
 imp NR : c9 leaves white a good move at d10 later
 imp NR : so d10
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, higher seems better in this game
 jansteen 3d*:  Next moves hard, I just play them
 jansteen 3d*:  White wants to use q6 stone somehow
 imp NR : he does not trust us enough:)

 jansteen 3d*:  Well, this is definitely not in my repertoire :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Go Seigen
 jansteen 3d*:  Could be, he has very explicit ideas about efficiency of stones and shapes
 jansteen 3d*:  Well, shouzhuo if I have to write his name in Chinese it will also be wrong :)
 imp NR : difficult next move for w
 jansteen 3d*:  Wu Ching-Yuan :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Oh really? I didn't know that
 jansteen 3d*:  Ah, see :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move indeed difficult, ideas? (right side is urgent now)
 andreu 1k*: L-3?
 imp NR : r9 maybe?
 jansteen 3d*:  Good thought martin
 jansteen 3d*:  r9 seems traditional move, but slightly lacks sharpness
 jansteen 3d*:  r13 interesting as well
 imp NR : r12 then?
 imp NR : or r6 something to think about:)
 jansteen 3d*:  It's too hard
 jansteen 3d*:  Good imp!

 jansteen 3d*:  Comment says: kiai, determined

;B[pk]
;W[nn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move (direction)?
 imp NR : o8
 jansteen 3d*:  Good imp
]
;B[mk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This illustrates why thickness works "elsewhere"
 imp NR : w cannot cut, since then b takes ko
 jansteen 3d*:  When opponent plays near thickness you don't need to answer locally
 jansteen 3d*:  The moves don't affect the black wall
]
;W[mn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Direction?
 andreu 1k*: L 6?
 imp NR : no n7 instead of n6?
 jansteen 3d*:  Good andreu!
]
;B[kn]
;W[ll]
;B[lk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next (shape)?
 imp NR : and again no n7 (instead of l6) :)
 jansteen 3d*:  m7, then k8 and white in trouble
 andreu 1k*: o8 is kinda painful, but...
 jansteen 3d*:  This shape occurs often, remember ot!
 jansteen 3d*:  ot = it
 jansteen 3d*:  right shouzhuo
]
;W[km]C[
 imp NR : l7 or k7?
]
;B[jm]
;W[kl]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  l7/l8 is the shape by white in such shape
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, cannot be helped
 jansteen 3d*:  Attack from top or left now?
 imp NR : good question:)
 imp NR : seems k10 normal
 jansteen 3d*:  k10 would be shape when attacking from the top (attack with keima)
 jansteen 3d*:  What's shape when attack from left?
 imp NR : j8
 jansteen 3d*:  Good imp!
]
;B[il]
;W[jk]C[
 imp NR : be right back
 jansteen 3d*:  Of course black can not capture this group
 wrferrer 11k*:  jansteen. a question. if instead of k7 black plays m7. what is white's answer?
 jansteen 3d*:  So black has to think something clever here, ideas?
 imp NR : ok:)
 jansteen 3d*:  In that case, wrferrer, white might play like: m6, n7, and then n8-r8 and sacrifice some stones
 imp NR : i like k16 now
 jansteen 3d*:  Agree wrferrer?
 wrferrer 11k*:  tell jansteen i am thinking , will answer in a few minutes!
 jansteen 3d*:  ok :)
 jansteen 3d*:  No other ideas?
 imp NR : k16 no good? :(
 jansteen 3d*:  In Chess, the next move is very common strategic idea
 imp NR : then f15 maybe?
 jansteen 3d*:  k16 would try to implement a leaning attack
 wrferrer 11k*:  thx jansteen. i understand now.
 jansteen 3d*:  But k16 very far away from white center group :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, imp! Why?
 hola 9k : somewhere around l11?
 imp NR : then try for double attack:)
 imp NR : glad to have you back shou:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, imp, in Chess similar idea is: one weakness not enough to win, create another one as well
 imp NR : ah, ic:)

;B[hd]
;W[gd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 jansteen 3d*:  Black gained f12 stone, try to use it :)
 jansteen 3d*:  g12 is too direct
 jansteen 3d*:  h11 leaves hole :)
 jansteen 3d*:  g12 very thick, but slow
 imp NR : k11?
 Tjl 5k*:  But do we need thickness in that direction?
 Tjl 5k*:  h11?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes imp you win again!

;B[ji]C[
 Tjl 5k*:  g11?
 Tjl 5k*:  probe?

 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, imp is strong!
 imp NR : thx, but "lucky" might be better:)
 Tjl 5k*:  j9?
]
;W[ik]
;B[hi]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  And now we see black's strategy: h9 or k16 getting serious now
 Tjl 5k*:  h8?
]
;W[gk]C[
 Tjl 5k*:  f7?
 jansteen 3d*:  No shouzhuo, it's a counted game
 Tjl 5k*:  or m6?
 Tjl 5k*:  threaten n8 and k6
 imp NR : w still have a few things to work with i think
 jansteen 3d*:  I try to understand next two moves
 jansteen 3d*:  I play next two moves and maybe we can join thoughts :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next two moves make no sense to me
 jansteen 3d*:  Here they come.... :)
]
;B[gm]
;W[ln]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, ideas?
 Tjl 5k*:  Why does g7 not make sense?
 jansteen 3d*:  Ideas about these moves?
 imp NR : b needed a re-enforcement there
 Tjl 5k*: Why does g7 not make sense
 imp NR : then w m6 no longer aji-keshi
 Tjl 5k*: M6 threatens n8 and k6
 imp NR : erasing (other) possibilities
 jansteen 3d*:  g7 seems to prevent a white action around k6
 jansteen 3d*:  m6 is probably necessary enforment of the white group
 imp NR : there is still a white cut if w connects the ko
 Tjl 5k*: k6?
 Tjl 5k*: What ko?
 jansteen 3d*:  ok, thanks :()
 jansteen 3d*:  :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Back to the game, next bklack move?
 imp NR : ko at o3
 Tjl 5k*: I'm blind
 jansteen 3d*:  Black didn't k4
 Tjl 5k*: k4 too much aji keshi - q2 is now sente
 jansteen 3d*:  Blac continued strategy
 Tjl 5k*: f8?
 imp NR : agree Tjl

 jansteen 3d*:  Pros are always very possitive when being attacked :)
 Tjl 5k*: Yes, if w gets h13 or h14, J18 works
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, imp, agree, very complicated
 Tjl 5k*: and W is safe. Therefore B h13 no threat yet
