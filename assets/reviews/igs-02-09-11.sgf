 imp NR : you will miss something, chocolate:)
 jansteen 3d*:  This is the second round of the 45th NHK title
 imp NR : quick games?
 jansteen 3d*:  This tournament is knockout, so both players won one game
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, 10 min each + 30 sec byo yomi
 imp NR : thx
 jansteen 3d*:  sure :)

;B[ce]
;W[dn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move is natural, which one?
 jansteen 3d*:  Consider c15 as well, robert
 imp NR : c8?
 jansteen 3d*:  Correct
]
;B[cl]C[
 imp NR : or perhaps e16?
 jansteen 3d*:  c8 attacks d6 and sets up the nice follow-up on...?
 imp NR : e16:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, imp :)
 jansteen 3d*:  So white's next move is also natural, where?
 imp NR : e16 again:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, e16 direction anyway
]
;W[fd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's next again natural, where?
 imp NR : i see many naturals:)
 jansteen 3d*:  How can black follow-up c8?
 imp NR : f4?
 imp NR : hi malf:)
 jansteen 3d*:  yes, correct imp, 100 percent!
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi malf :)
]
;B[fp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Now what to do with d6?
 donjuan 2d*: hoi
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi don Juan :)
 imp NR : hoi donjuan:)
 imp NR : I would feel to play around c11 now
 jansteen 3d*:  c11 is positive
 imp NR : you are not going to tell me that w played a negative one? :)
 donjuan 2d*: hm my kibitz doesnt work that well
 jansteen 3d*:  But black e7 would be hard on both c11 and d6
 donjuan 2d*: hello anyway ;:)
 jansteen 3d*:  We see your kibitz Don
$)C
 donjuan 2d*: sure with kib but not with 4Š
 jansteen 3d*:  Isn't kibitz a ","?
 imp NR : difficult to find something for d6 that is not only passive
 donjuan 2d*: unknown command also...
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi David
 imp NR : kibitz is a "
 jansteen 3d*:  David is a walking manual
 donjuan 2d*: i think d6 is light
 donjuan 2d*: play elsewhere?=
 jansteen 3d*:  So what are you saying Juan, c11 around as well?
 jansteen 3d*:  Left side is hot, but where then?
 donjuan 2d*: yeah something like that :=)
 imp NR : d12, but is that right direction now?
 donjuan 2d*: maybe d11
 jansteen 3d*:  d12 is better than c11 I think
 jansteen 3d*:  d11 invites black e7 too much and leaves c15 with c13 for base
 donjuan 2d*: i miss to play go... :(
 jansteen 3d*:  c10 same comments as d11
 jansteen 3d*:  I think d12 is possible
 imp NR : or c16 first, then d12? Might be overplay that
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, white decided to move with d6, how?
 donjuan 2d*: but e7 leaves d4 aji
 imp NR : problem also: if b e7, is there still life left in d6 or not? If not, than have to move d6
]
;W[em]C[
 imp NR : this invites d12 now
 jansteen 3d*:  True imp, black d7 would leave white d6 with some life in it
 jansteen 3d*:  But moving it would be really hard :)
 jansteen 3d*:  This is the only reasonable way to move this stone
 donjuan 2d*: e8?
 jansteen 3d*:  Why e8 Juan?
 donjuan 2d*: no idcea :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, you know, but pls tell us :)
 imp NR : locally normal, to build left side
 donjuan 2d*: settle upper side, and f6 peep
 imp NR : :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Correct, black needs to defend against d12
 jansteen 3d*:  He choose another move, not touching the weak e7 group

 imp NR : i feel that this is enough for b
 imp NR : for what that's worth:)

;B[qk]
;W[hq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next black move? (direction, shape)
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi zion
 imp NR : hi:)
 jansteen 3d*:  g5 is shape because it has follow-up at j4 and seperates white's groups
 jansteen 3d*:  Other suggestions?
 imp NR : c4
 imp NR : but than around g5 too good for w
 imp NR : f6 maybe?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes imp, you got it
]
;B[fn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  g6 is vital point of the kosumi shape d6/e7
 jansteen 3d*:  It also sets up an invasion around l4
 jansteen 3d*:  Simple, severe, pro trademark

;W[fm]
;B[gm]
;W[gn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next? (shape, tesuji)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes zion!
 imp NR : or first h6?
]
;B[hp]C[
 donjuan 2d*: h6 or just g8?
 jansteen 3d*:  This move has j3 and h6 follow-up

;W[hn]
;B[iq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  pls note that g8 ladder is good for black, so....
]
;W[fo]
;B[gq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  An exchange (furikawari) is the result
 donjuan 2d*: why g8 impoertant?
 imp NR : g8?
 jansteen 3d*:  Because g7 was cutting stone Juan :)
 jansteen 3d*:  So black f5 was a threat
 donjuan 2d*: ahhh i sea
 imp NR : oh, you mean miai?
 jansteen 3d*:  Which sea? :)
 jansteen 3d*:  right imp
 donjuan 2d*: probably the north sea
 jansteen 3d*:  White to play right side, candidates?
 imp NR : r11 only?
 jansteen 3d*:  is that right side zion? :)
 darkoasis 1k*:  R6
 donjuan 2d*: i would play o17
 darkoasis 1k*: ooops white to play
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, we have four moves :)
 darkoasis 1k*: R11
 jansteen 3d*:  r11/r14, r6 and p9
 donjuan 2d*: oh it is b turn
 darkoasis 1k*: scratch R6....
 jansteen 3d*:  r6 feels a bit tight
 imp NR : no, w to move dj:)
 darkoasis 1k*: I was thinking R6 for Black...not white :)
 jansteen 3d*:  p9 gives away territory, black will answer q11 happily
 donjuan 2d*: oops. then i say o17 ;:)
 jansteen 3d*:  So left are r11 and r14, which one?
]
;W[qi]C[
 darkoasis 1k*: Thanks for the suspense! :)  Jan
 jansteen 3d*:  So now two moves are obvious: either r6 or r13, which one?
 jansteen 3d*:  oasis :)
 darkoasis 1k*: Black R6
 imp NR : i vote r6
 imp NR : but r13 seems not bad too:)
 jansteen 3d*:  guys, we had this many times before
 jansteen 3d*:  r6 is completely gote, defensive, uninteresting
 donjuan 2d*: i think r13
 darkoasis 1k*: If black decides to tenuki...then J16 looks about right...but R6 is itching!!
 jansteen 3d*:  ama-move :)
 imp NR : shit:)
 jansteen 3d*:  r6 is chicken move :)
 darkoasis 1k*: gote or not...R6 is needed.
 imp NR : but BIG chicken move:)

;B[qf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Pro's always defend by attacking, try it in your own games, really
 darkoasis 1k*: Well hush my mouth!!
]
;W[oj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  And now two options: r6 or r5, which one?
 imp NR : hm, surprising this
 darkoasis 1k*: Pros can calculate to INFINITY...if we can do that...*then* we try it!! hehe
 darkoasis 1k*: I don't like either option...
 jansteen 3d*:  Not really imp, j3 is strong, so black's r9 group is ok, while white's r11 is dame point now
 imp NR : r6, then s4 after
]
;B[qo]C[
 darkoasis 1k*: but would choose R6 P8 here

;B[qn]

;B[pn]
;W[oo]
;B[ol]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Sabaki manouevre
 darkoasis 1k*: Finally P8!!
 darkoasis 1k*: Very instructive, Jan.
 imp NR : hard for w now?
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, this group is ok for the time being, so shift to upper-side now
 jansteen 3d*:  Which point on upper-side?
 imp NR : o17
 donjuan 2d*: k17?
 jansteen 3d*:  Two opinions: keep distance (k17) or all the way (o17), which one?
 darkoasis 1k*: I have no idea!!
 darkoasis 1k*: O17 unreasonable...
 imp NR : we don't have either, just guessing:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Is white p10 group weak or strong?
 donjuan 2d*: maybe j17 :)
 darkoasis 1k*: maybe L16
 imp NR : weak:(
 darkoasis 1k*: extremely weak!!
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes imp, so is o17 reasonable?
 darkoasis 1k*: was that a trick question?!! ::grins::
 imp NR : i wanted to o17 to weaken corner:) That makes p10 stronger
 darkoasis 1k*: White L17 and pray.
 jansteen 3d*:  Good mentality imp, what can I say :))
 jansteen 3d*:  haha
 imp NR : maybe slightly overoptimistic:)
 imp NR : i prefer b now anyway
 darkoasis 1k*: Too optomistic...but if Jan's earlier comment is correct...
]
;W[kc]C[
 darkoasis 1k*: the pros defend by attacking!! hehe
 darkoasis 1k*: YES!!!!!!!!
 imp NR : good:)
 jansteen 3d*:  This move protects h17, sets up o17 and helps p10 group
 darkoasis 1k*: Thanks. Imp!
 jansteen 3d*:  In a position where you feel behind (and white probably is slightly) you have to play rtight
 jansteen 3d*:  tight
 darkoasis 1k*: I would rather be a fake3d!! ::grins::  Go for it!!
 jansteen 3d*:  Play tight and wait for chance, lick your wounds, and gain strength
 jansteen 3d*:  Wait for your chance, which always comes
]
;B[mc]
;W[ke]C[
 imp NR : true:)
 darkoasis 1k*: Jan...that's what my girlfriend says...wait for your chance, which always comes!!
 darkoasis 1k*: hehe
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's upper-right looks very big but actually white can still invade
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move? (direction most important)
 jansteen 3d*:  Think strategically
 jansteen 3d*:  Don't worry about territory
 darkoasis 1k*: Black B17...Too small?!
 imp NR : n10?
 donjuan 2d*: k16 i tyhink...
 jansteen 3d*:  b17 is huge pre-endgame move
 darkoasis 1k*: B17 prepares a J17 invasion.
 jansteen 3d*:  What's the strategic idea behind n10?
 jansteen 3d*:  Same question for k16
 imp NR : keep the w center under control
 imp NR : f14 also, but maybe too soft?
 jansteen 3d*:  What's the strategic idea in this position?
 imp NR : seems a pity not to attack r11/p10 stones though
 imp NR : simply p12 then?
 donjuan 2d*: q10 is possible, imp
 darkoasis 1k*: is N3 too slow for black?
 jansteen 3d*:  n3 is very small oasis
 jansteen 3d*:  n3 doeasn't affect the corner
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, I continue
]
;B[lf]C[
 darkoasis 1k*: my oasis is verys small too!!
 imp NR : for me, around e12 or around weak group is biggest
 jansteen 3d*:  What's this move? Pls explain imp :)
 darkoasis 1k*: M14 looks like an overplay here...
 imp NR : separate , so attack
 darkoasis 1k*: no wonder these are pros!! :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, imp
]
;W[md]C[
 darkoasis 1k*: but black may loose the J17 invasion with this sequence...
 imp NR : but why not p12 then?
 darkoasis 1k*: I guess the right side is more important.
 imp NR : m14 difficult:)
 jansteen 3d*:  m14 is one of those "feeling" moves
 imp NR : ah, ic:)
 darkoasis 1k*: Very difficult...I would try to lull white asleep with B17...
 jansteen 3d*:  I don't like p12, it doesn't help UR a lot
 darkoasis 1k*: I know its slow...but its still painful for white to ignore!
 jansteen 3d*:  p12 squeezes white out and leaves weaknesses behinbd
 donjuan 2d*: m16 then.
]
;B[nc]C[
 imp NR : true that
]
;W[nf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White still wants to connect of course
 imp NR : but b needs a good one now
 jansteen 3d*:  And black wants to seperate..., next?
 donjuan 2d*: m16?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, o12 around is correct
 jansteen 3d*:  Find best shape here is hard

 darkoasis 1k*: zion...doesn't black's M14 look like an overplay?!
 jansteen 3d*:  This flows naturally
 jansteen 3d*:  So black entered center, white while got o12 wall, what's next?
 darkoasis 1k*: white B16 or there abouts.
 jansteen 3d*:  They leave this shape, zion
 jansteen 3d*:  What did white get in return for his losses here?
 imp NR : a move in UR?
 jansteen 3d*:  c16 not urgent yet
 jansteen 3d*:  Right imp
 jansteen 3d*:  White plays in UR, which point?
 imp NR : your "wall" tipped me off:)
 darkoasis 1k*: my goodness...white invade at R17?!! no way!!
 donjuan 2d*: r17?
 jansteen 3d*:  s16 interesting (miai of r17 and s14)
 jansteen 3d*:  r17 traditional point
 jansteen 3d*:  Try to use n16
 darkoasis 1k*: then P17 attach...
 darkoasis 1k*: that keeps sente, no matter what.

 jansteen 3d*:  See relationship between this point and n16?

 imp NR : yes, too difficult for me:)

 darkoasis 1k*: but this probe is normal for ogeima shimari...
 darkoasis 1k*: but very tough to see here.
 jansteen 3d*:  Now two moves miai: p16 and q15
 imp NR : i calculated that this does not work:)
 jansteen 3d*:  So what's black's next then imp? :)
 darkoasis 1k*: I vote with the Imp!! :)
 darkoasis 1k*: Black's next move is to call Sataka Eio!! :)
 imp NR : b q18, then what?

 darkoasis 1k*: Sakata!!
 jansteen 3d*:  This is the game

 jansteen 3d*:  And now?
 darkoasis 1k*: Black S16 is copeout...but *I* would play it...
 imp NR : ah.., problems after p17 take:)
 darkoasis 1k*: then connect at S18 or thereabouts.
 imp NR : if we could learn this zion:)
]
;B[oc]C[
 darkoasis 1k*: should white tenuki now...and get in B16 or C16?
 imp NR : if only we could learn this:(
 imp NR : r15 now?
 darkoasis 1k*: black is going to invade at J17 next...
 darkoasis 1k*: white might as well get some profit in the upper left corner first.
 imp NR : jan has net trouble?
 imp NR : yes
 darkoasis 1k*: I think so...yes to both.
 imp NR : :)
 darkoasis 1k*: C16 or B16 for white...has to be huge by now!!
 imp NR : are there other proposals?
 darkoasis 1k*: Another proposal is a kikashi at C4 for white.
 imp NR : but s14 for w seems not enough now?
 darkoasis 1k*: Jan is trapped in GO Heaven. :)
 imp NR : ok
 darkoasis 1k*: Okay zion
 imp NR : after r15-r14, p15-o13, a semeai occurs that w must be able to win, otherwise r15 no good

 imp NR : what is m9 for jan?
 darkoasis 1k*: White C4 is *almost* sente...black would probably ignore it.

 darkoasis 1k*: I agree...awfully big...
 darkoasis 1k*: but these are pros...
 darkoasis 1k*: black would ignore it.
 imp NR : jan has bad trouble with connection
 imp NR : too many questions yes:)
 darkoasis 1k*: chuckles:: Thanks, zion!
 imp NR : you seem to be strongest around now ziion: can you explain m9?
 imp NR : m16 attacks w group, not completely alive yet. Treatens s8
 imp NR : maybe:)
 darkoasis 1k*: my guess is...M9 assists the F7 group, while preventing black from stretching out too much.
 darkoasis 1k*: zion...when white played M9...
 darkoasis 1k*: give us some comments on that.
 krugman 5k*: seems  w about 50 secure; b 35-40 secure plus whatever left side; who has more scope to expand??
 CWine 2d :  What is going on here?  Everything safe, unless W can unsettle left side.
 darkoasis 1k*: ::nods::  if white M9 is not present...how black play in this area?
 darkoasis 1k*: Lets assume previous play on the *outer fringes* away from the center."
 darkoasis 1k*: In other words...black would aim at pulling the G7 stone out, if white tenuki's too long?
 imp NR : seems b a bit ahead, but white got back a bit i think
 imp NR : upper, LR,
 krugman 5k*: left side not terr yet
 imp NR : think so yes
 krugman 5k*: can w press down left side and develop center with  m9 holding right flank??
 imp NR : i propose to stop now, and to wait till jan comes back.
 zli 7k*:  you guys can watch 70 now
 imp NR : He seems to have bad net trouble (already 11 m time out)
 imp NR : cu back soon:)
 imp NR : cu malf:)
 darkoasis 1k*: welcome back, Jan :)
 jansteen 3d*:  My network is very unstable tonight it seems
 jansteen 3d*:  thanks :)
 jansteen 3d*:  So I will speed up this game to ensure we finish it
 imp NR : digging in the neighbourhood:)
 jansteen 3d*:  White played kikashi with m9, and black responded kikashi at m16
 darkoasis 1k*: White M15 was the consensus.

 imp NR : for those that did not watch Yasuda-Guo game:)
 darkoasis 1k*: White ataries under at K18...will continue with J18 if black tries to pull out.
 darkoasis 1k*: My other observation was...
 jansteen 3d*:  Good oasis, correct
 imp NR : oh no, jansteen-hobo game that was?
 darkoasis 1k*: isn't it interesting...that neither white plays L3 or black plays N3 here...
 darkoasis 1k*: a brief comment on those moves which seem big...but or not.
 jansteen 3d*:  That part of the board is very "hard" oasis, so moves there are small
 jansteen 3d*:  Since the positions are hard, a move their doesn't affect the situation a lot
 jansteen 3d*:  their = there
 darkoasis 1k*: ::nods:: if either side plays there... a fight will ensure...
 darkoasis 1k*: that doesn't gain much for either side?
 darkoasis 1k*: Okay...ready to continue. :)
 jansteen 3d*:  If white plays k3 it doesn't affect j3, if black plays n3 it doesn't affect p3
 imp NR : more like: only points, no follow-up action
 imp NR : but big enough to be played soon i guess
 darkoasis 1k*: Gotcha :)  Thanks :)
 jansteen 3d*:  So only profit is 10 points in gote, right imp

 jansteen 3d*:  By the way, anyone has an idea why white fell behind in this game?
 imp NR : bye and thx all
 Max 2d*: fell behind in yose?
 imp NR : i think because of p10
 darkoasis 1k*: Yes...the Q17 maneuver....
 darkoasis 1k*: it was played a bit too soon.
 jansteen 3d*:  CLose imp!
 jansteen 3d*:  Was r11 correct?
 imp NR : after that action there, w was behind
 jansteen 3d*:  right
 imp NR : i voted for r11 jan! :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes imp :) But was it correct?
 imp NR : sure:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Right zion, what then?
 darkoasis 1k*: R11 can't be wrong...
 darkoasis 1k*: the maneuvers in the upper right corner could have waited...
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, r11 direction is good, but point was wrong
 darkoasis 1k*: white needed to take care of the upper left first.
 imp NR : but w should have got r7-direction?
 jansteen 3d*:  no oasis, r11 direction was correct
 jansteen 3d*:  right, r14 was correct
 darkoasis 1k*: I agree with R11...I am saying...
 darkoasis 1k*: that after that...the Q17 attach in the corner was not timed right.
 imp NR : :( so zion was right after all:)
 darkoasis 1k*: it could have waited a bit longer.
 jansteen 3d*:  r14, black answers in corner and then white r11
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, zion was right after all :)
 jansteen 3d*:  imp plays as strong as Mimura, zion as Kobayashi :)
 Max 2d*: wow, such an early usually doesn't make any difference in my games in 1000 years
 imp NR : :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Such a basic position, and even pro's can go wrong, very interesting
 imp NR : ok, bedtime here
 imp NR : bye all:)
 jansteen 3d*:  It shows that no move in Go is for "free", always have to think a moment :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Me too, too late, bye all

 darkoasis 1k*: Take care :)
 jansteen 3d*:  :)
