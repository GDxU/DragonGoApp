 colombe 2d*: hi all
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi colombe
 colombe 2d*: jansteen, i will sent you my phone bill :=)
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, then I send you mine :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Highest takes all :)
 colombe 2d*: haha
]
;W[pj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi donjuan!
 colombe 2d*: hi european go champion!
 jansteen 3d*:  White tenuki-ed top, so it's natural black will do something there now
 jansteen 3d*:  Any ideas?
 colombe 2d*: we prepared a new event in marseille
 jansteen 3d*:  Pls explain the new idea colombe
 jansteen 3d*:  Meanwhile we continue the game

 colombe 2d*: well go-tactic is very skillful event based upon life and death problem
 jansteen 3d*:  g13 was to induce j15, taking liberty for l16 cut
 jansteen 3d*:  But strange anyway :)
]
;W[mc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White trying to deal with cutting point creatively
]
;B[nd]

 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 jansteen 3d*:  ha :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move features basics of Go: connecting and cutting
]
;W[gc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Connecting white's weak group, and big in itself

 jansteen 3d*:  This is a lightning game, so presumably b14 was to gain another 30 sec to think
 jansteen 3d*:  Next for black?
 fisica 11k*: around l4?
 jansteen 3d*:  No, something like 10 min thinking time and next 30 sec byo yomi
 jansteen 3d*:  When you move within 30 sec you don't use thinking time
 jansteen 3d*:  There is a very attractive point now, large for both
 jansteen 3d*:  l4 is not extremely urgent since o3 can still jump into r3
 jansteen 3d*:  besides, black has f3 to enter bottom
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, donjuan!
]
;B[qh]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  r12 is large, and sets up either s10 (points) or q8 (attack)
]
;W[qc]
;B[rd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next? (punish black for leaving o3)
 jansteen 3d*:  Black can settle easily in that case using q3 for example
 jansteen 3d*:  yes!

 jansteen 3d*:  And now?
 fisica 11k*: k3?

;W[kn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next black move is hard to evaluate
]
;B[pl]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move makes a connection between q10 and q6 more difficult
 jansteen 3d*:  But white can attack black again

 jansteen 3d*:  Black did well, no?
 jansteen 3d*:  q8 a very interesting idea
 jansteen 3d*:  White 80 (j7) is Kataoka style: thick
 jansteen 3d*:  However, p8 also very thick
 jansteen 3d*:  Tokyo Cup, title in Japan
]
;W[lg]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White has to reduce this territory
]
;B[ig]
;W[oh]C[
 wferrer 9k :  one question. if instead of p7 white plays m7 is it very bad?
 jansteen 3d*:  Black can use p8 in another way, next move?
 jansteen 3d*:  wferrer: white wants to move to the left because of: 1. Cutting point at f6, 2. Black's territory there
 jansteen 3d*:  o13 comes a bit later donjuan
 jansteen 3d*:  r5 is right spirit
 jansteen 3d*:  point choosen is differently though
 jansteen 3d*:  right shouzxhuo

 wferrer 9k :  thx jansteen.
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi shou
 jansteen 3d*:  pros almost invariably play p2 when black r3, but in this case living seems best
 jansteen 3d*:  Now black gained strength at bottom, so attack at top seems natural, ideas?
 jansteen 3d*:  Not o13 direwolf
 jansteen 3d*:  Who did you play, homeless?
 jansteen 3d*:  Attack upper-right colombe
 jansteen 3d*:  Not o13, the move played seems very modest
]

 jansteen 3d*:  I'm sure you all thought about capturing from o13 :)
 jansteen 3d*:  (including me of course :)

;W[ni]
;B[pi]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Commentary says black 93 is very severe and hard to resist by white
 jansteen 3d*:  Next white move seems obvious, agree
 jansteen 3d*:  Is f6 possible here?
 jansteen 3d*:  White played elsewhere first shouzhuo
]
;W[gl]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  White is looking at f6 cut and reducing black's center
 jansteen 3d*:  So after f6 black will sacrifice it, shouzhuo?
 jansteen 3d*:  ok, agree
 jansteen 3d*:  White has some bad aji at the top, black's next move exploits it, where?
]
;B[gd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Oh, how does it continue shouzhuo?
 jansteen 3d*:  g6 and g7 you mean?
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, looks good, thanks :)
