     bent4, NR :  recent game?
  jansteen, 3d*: This is the semi final of the Ryu-Sei Cup
     bent4, NR :  thanks
      club, 3d*: hi, jans.  :-)
  jansteen, 3d*: Hi club
]
;B[hd]C[
      club, 3d*: who's game?
  jansteen, 3d*: Hane Yasumasa (9p,B) vs Kobayashi Koichi (9p,W)

;W[dg];B[ee];W[fe];B[ef];W[dd]
;B[cf]C[
       imp, NR : hope w will play b17 in a moment...
]
;W[cc];B[ce];W[ff];B[eg];W[bc]C[
       imp, NR : aha:)
       imp, NR : f16 now
      club, 3d*: imp good prediction.  :-)
      club, 3d*: f16 very complicated...
  jansteen, 3d*: This joseki always concentrates around the shicho \
which evolves in this line when black cuts at f16
  jansteen, 3d*: So when the players play this joseki they always \
look at the diagonal corner
       imp, NR : i heard say that f16 now is only
  jansteen, 3d*: The position there affects black's choice in the \
upper-left
  jansteen, 3d*: This game is no exception
  jansteen, 3d*: right imp
]
;B[fd]C[
       imp, NR : but earlier a ladder breaker was also played first
  jansteen, 3d*: Even if the ladder is bad for black, a ladder \
breaker in lower-right is usually enough compensation
]
;W[gd];B[fc];W[gc]
C[
  jansteen, 3d*: What's shape here?
  jansteen, 3d*: (for black)
  jansteen, 3d*: If you know joseki this is an easy question
      club, 3d*: funny, lots of this played, perhaps I should try \
it.  :-)
      club, 3d*: e18
       imp, NR : e18:)
  jansteen, 3d*: Right
]
;B[eb]C[
      club, 3d*: too complicated.  :-)
  jansteen, 3d*: Black e18 makes d17 and g18 miai
       imp, NR : not too, club:)
      club, 3d*: too much for me.  :-)
  jansteen, 3d*: There is one way white can resist, and he should
      club, 3d*: I mean later on.  :-)
]
;W[ec];B[fb];W[gb]C[
  jansteen, 3d*: This is the most severe line of play
]
;B[db];W[dc];B[ge]C[
       imp, NR : i know this variation, so i let the others guess \
for a while:)
      club, 3d*: j18 only move?
  jansteen, 3d*: Black's threat now is j17, so next move is only \
move
]
;W[ib];B[ic];W[hb]
C[
       imp, NR : what is tricky now is to see that b needs the \
shicho to capture: nothing else works
  jansteen, 3d*: And now if lower-right is black, white is captured \
with h13
       imp, NR : h13 does not work i think
       imp, NR : w g13
  jansteen, 3d*: What's wrong with h13 imp?
       imp, NR : oh, if LR is black, then ok
  jansteen, 3d*: Right
       imp, NR : but not now: w plays g13 and is out
  jansteen, 3d*: exactly
  jansteen, 3d*: It's interesting to see the function of white's \
d13 stone in this variation
       imp, NR : shocho-breaker:)
  jansteen, 3d*: Because of d13 also the ladder which goes to the \
left doesn't work
  jansteen, 3d*: Right :)
  jansteen, 3d*: Ok, so what's black's next move?
      club, 3d*: ladder breaker at LR ?
  jansteen, 3d*: btw, should I show what we were just talking about?
  jansteen, 3d*: Right, black plays a ladder breaker in lower-right
      club, 3d*: o4 ?
  jansteen, 3d*: The traditional one is o4, right, what's the follow-up?
      club, 3d*: then q6
  jansteen, 3d*: right o4, and q6
  jansteen, 3d*: Black choose a different one
      club, 3d*: seen too many of them.  :-)
       imp, NR : p4?
  jansteen, 3d*: p4 is possible as well, although not so severe
       imp, NR : also traditional:)
  jansteen, 3d*: The reason is that white can answer once
      club, 3d*: could it be p5 ?
]
;B[oo]C[
  jansteen, 3d*: That's the move played
]
;W[gf]C[
       imp, NR : never seen this
]
;B[he]C[
      club, 3d*: interesting...
]
;W[hf];B[op];W[pq];B[oq]C[
  jansteen, 3d*: Next white move (shape)?
       imp, NR : r6?
  jansteen, 3d*: yes, correct
]
;W[qn]C[
  jansteen, 3d*: If white q5 instead, black will hane
  jansteen, 3d*: Next move?
       imp, NR : b needs three moves now:)
  jansteen, 3d*: :)
  jansteen, 3d*: Which moves imp?
       imp, NR : d4, d10, and k4
  jansteen, 3d*: Right, the correct move is amongst them
     dasch, 3d*: why there is no b stone at k 18?
       imp, NR : and i would like to get p7 too:)
  jansteen, 3d*: Well, correct, the move played in the game :)
  jansteen, 3d*: So black has an interesting position, so many \
nice moves available :)
  jansteen, 3d*: Hi David
       imp, NR : i would feel stressed:)
     dasch, 3d*: hi Jan
     dasch, 3d*: hi all
       imp, NR : hi dasch:)
      club, 3d*: hi, dasch...  :-)
  jansteen, 3d*: There is no stone at k18 David
     dasch, 3d*: why?Should be ordinary?
  jansteen, 3d*: Hmm, I don't know
     dasch, 3d*: seems to be a loss for b
  jansteen, 3d*: Black can also use the shortage of liberties in \
the center
  jansteen, 3d*: Considering black's next move, kikashi in center \
more useful than k18 maybe?
       imp, NR : this used to be normal i think, but maybe nowadays \
k18 is normal dasch?
    jasper, NR : g12?, :-)
     dasch, 3d*: this seems to be a new strategy?
  jansteen, 3d*: Let's see the game continuation
]
;B[dp]C[
     dasch, 3d*: nice extetion :)
  jansteen, 3d*: Double extension :)
     dasch, 3d*: extention
  jansteen, 3d*: So white's next move is predictable
  jansteen, 3d*: Any ideas?
     dasch, 3d*: d11 :)
  jansteen, 3d*: Yes, similarly was played
]
;W[dj]
C[
  jansteen, 3d*: Black's next is also normal, where and why?
     dasch, 3d*: b12?
  jansteen, 3d*: b12 (or c12) is passive, white will c6
     dasch, 3d*: fight?
       imp, NR : f12 too much?
  jansteen, 3d*: yes, but how?
   tmartin,10k*:  b can g3 to enclose most of bottom
      club, 3d*: j14
  jansteen, 3d*: g3 is nice move, but gote and ignoring white's \
attack in UL
       imp, NR : urgent before big moves tmartin
     dasch, 3d*: something like j14?
  jansteen, 3d*: j14 induces g12, and then club?
      club, 3d*: then e11 ?
  jansteen, 3d*: Hmm, strange, black's next move is so very normal \
:)
     dasch, 3d*: i agree
       imp, NR : then d12:)
  jansteen, 3d*: Black c12 or e11 is just walking away with weak \
group, not possitive enough
     dasch, 3d*: c8
  jansteen, 3d*: d12 is same idea as c12 or f12/e11, passive
   tmartin,10k*:  maybe c6, threatening
  jansteen, 3d*: Yes, David, c8 is direction here
       imp, NR : d8?
      club, 3d*: d7
   tmartin,10k*:  d8 looks big
  jansteen, 3d*: c8 prevents that white gets a base as well, makes \
the fight even
  jansteen, 3d*: But now where, c8 is low, or maybe d8 (high), \
or c6, or d6, or... ?
   tmartin,10k*:  so c9?
]
;B[dm]C[
  jansteen, 3d*: Club got it
      club, 3d*: w/ all jan's hints...  :-)
  jansteen, 3d*: Yasuda Yasutoshi ones explained me the following...
       imp, NR : we are bad tonight:)
  jansteen, 3d*: When doubting about c8, d8, ...
     dasch, 3d*: c 13
  jansteen, 3d*: If there is no good reason to play low, then play \
high
      club, 3d*: make sense, jans.  :-)
  jansteen, 3d*: In this case: c8 would overlap black's c14, so \
high is better
       imp, NR : and w cannot keep b enclosed now?
    skyfox, 1k : what is this game?
  jansteen, 3d*: yes, club, but when phrased by a pro it's nice \
as rule :)
      club, 3d*: f12.
   tmartin,10k*:  it's that idea of balance I find so difficult
]
;W[gi]C[
  jansteen, 3d*: This move looks very impressive
      club, 3d*: yes, g11 much better.
      club, 3d*: good move...pro move... :-)
  jansteen, 3d*: Strengthens g14 and d10, attacks UL and helps \
for invading bottom
    skyfox, 1k : who are the players of this game, jan?
       imp, NR : now b has a problem...
  jansteen, 3d*: Hane Yasumasa (9p,B) vs Kobayashi Koichi (9p,W)
    skyfox, 1k : thx, jan
   tmartin,10k*:  only one problem?  two weak groups
       imp, NR : oh, the other stones around h15 not so important \
now
       shk, 3d :  sacrifice everything
  jansteen, 3d*: Right imp, h15 and friends are kikashi for the \
time being
  jansteen, 3d*: UL is most urgent, how to strengthen these?
       imp, NR : without making w much stronger, that's the problem, \
no?
       shk, 3d :  d12?
  jansteen, 3d*: Preferably imp, right
  jansteen, 3d*: d12 is right idea

  jansteen, 3d*: Now white switches to the bottom
  jansteen, 3d*: Any suggestions?

  jansteen, 3d*: very good club!
  jansteen, 3d*: and imp!
  jansteen, 3d*: Why, pls explain
      club, 3d*: imp so strong!  :-)
   tmartin,10k*:  3-point extension either side
  jansteen, 3d*: There is a good reason for j3 instead of for example \
k4
       imp, NR : you where first, so...:)
  jansteen, 3d*: Yes, that's one reason martin, good
      club, 3d*: b LR and LL both strong
]
;W[iq]C[
        mp, 5k*: maybe because of g11, low is better?
]
;B[qo]C[
      club, 3d*: base more important for w now...
  jansteen, 3d*: This black move is the other reason, black's lower-right \
is extremely strong
   tmartin,10k*:  also w j5 good threat
  jansteen, 3d*: So white j3 keeps a respectable distance from \
these stones

  jansteen, 3d*: m3 is not good martin, you offer target for attack

        mp, 5k*: s7

  jansteen, 3d*: if white m3, black will happily play g3 and sequeeze \
white's group

away from the strengh

       imp, NR : would w s7 be alternative for j3, or is that too \
slow?
