 jansteen 3d*:  Hi, fine, thanks :)
 jansteen 3d*:  The left shape seems perfectly efficient for black, but according to Ishida that shape is even
 jansteen 3d*:  Not much to do anymore in this position
 jansteen 3d*:  Right
 jansteen 3d*:  Any ideas for white here?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, that's what I would play as well
 jansteen 3d*:  Want another guess?
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi malf, you have many names :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Oh, malf is malf
 jansteen 3d*:  I thought Purple is malf
 jansteen 3d*:  I think r13 is normal, but white played another move, also seems normal
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, whole board rather quiet
 jansteen 3d*:  No more suggestions for next white move?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, other than r13
 jansteen 3d*:  Very good zion, you're strong
]
;W[rd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Not lucky :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Now another question: when black plays top, where then?
 jansteen 3d*:  Hints help us to get stronger I hope :)
]
;B[hc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  When playing top this is the only interesting point
 jansteen 3d*:  The reason is that all points between are small and gote, black needs to go all the way
 jansteen 3d*:  This move at least gives black some follow-up's against white's top left
 jansteen 3d*:  Like e18, or f18, or e16 + g15
 jansteen 3d*:  White now?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, black not thin, but hard to explain why
 jansteen 3d*:  Can you, zion?
 jansteen 3d*:  Thin is more like when you pretend something "real" using loose shape
 jansteen 3d*:  Next white move makes a lot of sense, it's kiai
 jansteen 3d*:  "Going own way"
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, cymbalista got it
]
;W[qc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  The corner is huge
 jansteen 3d*:  With a nice follow-up waiting at q16
]
;B[he]
;W[pc]
;B[ne]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Pro's are magicians, black converted his upper-right corner into a deep moyo from the left toward the top
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, next move is important, have to invade the moyo, where pls? :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Right malf, maybe since this is lightning game he left his usual routine for once
 jansteen 3d*:  We have two proposals: l14 and m17, more pls :)
 jansteen 3d*:  l14 is near to actual game by the way
 jansteen 3d*:  White played kikashi first....
]
;W[el]
;B[dk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  and next...
]
;W[le]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move confuses black: should I defend or attack?
 jansteen 3d*:  I don't know :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Practical :)
]
;B[lc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  So white played kikashi twice
 jansteen 3d*:  What now?
 jansteen 3d*:  n3 shows good sense for direction, but white first jumped away lightly
 jansteen 3d*:  I can imagine malf, this is a difficult position
]
;W[kh]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  m12 and l12 both very good!
]
;B[jp]
;W[np]
;B[nq]
;W[lp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Again white makes black feel confused, am I attacked or attacker :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, o4 is imp's favorite
 jansteen 3d*:  I didn't see him play that move during European Go Congress though
 jansteen 3d*:  He was close fighting all the time :)
]
;B[jn]
;W[go]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, imp likes reading and complicated games
 jansteen 3d*:  White seperates black's stones around k6, black does similarly now, ideas?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, yes, zion is quick!

;W[mm]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Now black needs to think a little bit: what should he aim for here?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, getting iteresting :)
 jansteen 3d*:  What's black's plan here?
 seahawks 5k*: seperate upper w and bottom w
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, seahawks, that's correct
 jansteen 3d*:  m8 is interesting way to accomplish it
 jansteen 3d*:  l8 is common sense move: stay connected and try to split
 jansteen 3d*:  l7 is vital point: treatening n6 and n8
 jansteen 3d*:  Kobayashi played yet another move
 jansteen 3d*:  One more shot?
 jansteen 3d*:  g10 feels small at this stage cymbalista, it's gote 10 points
 jansteen 3d*:  l10 is nice move
]
;B[kk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move is compromise between: l10 (cap), l8 (attack with keima)
]
;W[mk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 jansteen 3d*:  You are zion, I'm sure
 jansteen 3d*:  Two moves come to mind: m10 and m11, which one?
]
;B[li]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This move has two follow-up moves: o10 and n13, both would confine a white group
 jansteen 3d*:  Right zion
 jansteen 3d*:  So what we learn here is that a move can be found easier when considering follow-up moves
]
;W[mg]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
]
;B[nj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Good zion :)
 jansteen 3d*:  White in trouble here

 jansteen 3d*:  In such a position (as white is) a professional is most dangerous
 jansteen 3d*:  He will look for weak spots in opponents position and try to use them
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, white in pain here

 jansteen 3d*:  White found a weak spot
 jansteen 3d*:  This might seem disaster for black, is it?
 jansteen 3d*:  Is it? :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Well, answer is: the black 6 stones are merely points, endgame, no strategic value
 jansteen 3d*:  No, not too big, about 15 points, but center much more important
 seahawks 5k*: m16?
 jansteen 3d*:  Besides, black already captured white's bottom group (30+ points)

 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, remarkable reading by both

 jansteen 3d*:  This moment is typical moment to count
 jansteen 3d*:  (when playing game)
 jansteen 3d*:  Reason is: "how much does black need to make in the center to win"?
 jansteen 3d*:  pls count...
 jansteen 3d*:  Ah, so black doesn't need any more territory zion?
 jansteen 3d*:  I count: white 85 + 5.5, black 94
 jansteen 3d*:  zion, did you forget 7 stone capture?
 jansteen 3d*:  Let's see what black played
]
;B[jc]
;W[oc]
;B[bn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  I count 10 points for black around k15
 jansteen 3d*:  Maybe not there but thickness will give black ten points somehow

;B[da]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  At this point white resigned, the board is too small now to catch up
 jansteen 3d*:  Shall we do one more count here?
 jansteen 3d*:  hmmm ;(
 jansteen 3d*:  b14 was sente
 jansteen 3d*:  White 76 + 5.5, black 86
 jansteen 3d*:  Did you include komi win100?
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, white resigned here
 jansteen 3d*:  Thanks for analysing together
 jansteen 3d*:  Next time probably Meijin league games
