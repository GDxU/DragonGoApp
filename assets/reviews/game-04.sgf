 jansteen 3d*: Any guesses for next white move (invasion, erasure of black moyo)?
 nbk 1d : H8?

;B[id]C[
 pwaldron 2d : Jan, is black's play in lr good?  He seems to have 3 moves in the corner and yet it's still invadable
 jansteen 3d*: True, pwaldron, we will see what will happen later.
 jansteen 3d*: Invading right now might damage the center group I feel
 Chucker 27k*: Why play top after b5?
 jansteen 3d*: c3 is a test move, no need to continue immediately
 Chucker 27k*: Thanks, what would be reply to b5 if he responded?
 jansteen 3d*: That will depend on the surrounding stones later on
