 jansteen 3d*:  I tought you were incognito :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi BigDog

 jansteen 3d*:  Hi club :)
 jansteen 3d*:  I don't agree :)
 imp NR : p17 is an option...
 jansteen 3d*:  In this kind of position r12 peep is valuable, so I played differently
 jansteen 3d*:  If black p13.....

 jansteen 3d*:  What's fun?
 jansteen 3d*:  Black wall doesn't work
 colombe 2d*: hi all
 colombe 2d*: commentary or game ?
 imp NR : i don't like your q14, but that's another problem
 jansteen 3d*:  You prefer oter tsuke, imp?
 imp NR : sure
 jansteen 3d*:  But then white will settle with r17 along right side
 colombe 2d*: can i participate to your debat ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Sure, colombe
 imp NR : of course, welcome:)
 colombe 2d*: what the problem ?
 jansteen 3d*:  We want to see imp's suggestion?
 jansteen 3d*:  I just explained malf :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, I go back
 colombe 2d*: P13 is not bad
 jansteen 3d*:  This, right imp?
 imp NR : yes
 jansteen 3d*:  Then we would get this result
 jansteen 3d*:  I didn't like q10 here
 jansteen 3d*:  lightning is fast
 colombe 2d*: why not block at r16 instead p17 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  But I guess it's a matter of taste?!
 jansteen 3d*:  Block at r16 is bad
 imp NR : maybe, this seems possible
 colombe 2d*: blocking at r16 is bad ?
 jansteen 3d*:  This is not joseki, only in hadicap games acceptable
 jansteen 3d*:  Look at o15 :)
 jansteen 3d*:  White gets too much here
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, game
 colombe 2d*: ok but i am not really convinced
 imp NR : e5-stone annoying:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Maybe black can ....
 imp NR : makes moyo building difficult
 jansteen 3d*:  Maybe like this?
 colombe 2d*: white gets here as much as before

 colombe 2d*: and black has more weaknesses

 jansteen 3d*:  Something like this
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, just showing hidden variations
 imp NR : white should hane instead
 imp NR : no
 jansteen 3d*:  What then? :)
 imp NR : r13?
 imp NR : after w hane
 imp NR : no:)
 jansteen 3d*:  And?
 imp NR : no s15,
 jansteen 3d*:  This?
 colombe 2d*: white gets a lots here too
 imp NR : ok, similar anyway:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Doesn't matter colombe, black outside is important
 jansteen 3d*:  This is Hane Yasumasa,9p variation
 jansteen 3d*:  He taught me
 imp NR : p15 may be most "normal", does your data base ...?
 jansteen 3d*:  Forget about q16 stones he said, go for outside! :)
 jansteen 3d*:  imp, all three are possible, I'm sure :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Sure, club, that means fighting
 imp NR : ok, guess your right yes:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, back to the game?
 imp NR : ok
 jansteen 3d*:  This makes Go interesting, trying other things
 jansteen 3d*:  If white plays usual way (r17) black is happy
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, club
 colombe 2d*: in a article of go world, q14 is very playable also
 imp NR : problems?
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi, back
 jansteen 3d*:  Sorry about this :)
 colombe 2d*: abck
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 jansteen 3d*:  Thanks :)
 colombe 2d*: back :=)
 jansteen 3d*:  Agree
 colombe 2d*: o14 seems necessary
 jansteen 3d*:  Right
 jansteen 3d*:  Liberties, patient
 colombe 2d*: white double hane here would be unbearable !
 jansteen 3d*:  Right colombe
 ls NR : may i ask a question?
 imp NR : sure:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Even hane alone is untorelable
 jansteen 3d*:  Sure, ls
 ls NR : w still has q17 or not?
 jansteen 3d*:  Hane is when white plays o14, top of chain
 imp NR : yes
 jansteen 3d*:  Right ls, q17 is aji
 ls NR : ok thx:)
 jansteen 3d*:  What's the Chinese for hane?
 imp NR : in fact, b has not much there
 jansteen 3d*:  Not true imp, q17 is gote
 jansteen 3d*:  And black s17 (to prevent q17) affects white's group (because black didn't p13)
 imp NR : ok, half of the time b has nothing:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Thanks jasper
 jansteen 3d*:  s17 now is too soon I think
 jansteen 3d*:  White's next move?
 craig 7k*: d3
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move triggers final fight of the game :)
 imp NR : j17 then? seems early:)
 jansteen 3d*:  White plans to build left side
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, j17 seems early, agree
 jansteen 3d*:  Black?
 colombe 2d*: h17 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  h17, then white happy with f17 I think
 colombe 2d*: f17 leaves many aji in the corner
 imp NR : you played f16, sure of that, but h16 also ok?
 craig 7k*: d16
 jansteen 3d*:  Right direwolf, ladder is ok for black
 jansteen 3d*:  h16, then f17 seems to take a large corner
 jansteen 3d*:  Black strong at top, white thin on left and ladder works; for me only one move: f16
 imp NR : ok:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Really "ok" imp?
 imp NR : (i would f16 too:)
 jansteen 3d*:  ko :)
 jansteen 3d*:  I mean ok :)

 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 colombe 2d*: e15
 Tjl 5k*:  f14 or e15
 colombe 2d*: without hesitation
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, f14 or e15 is normal in this sghape
 imp NR : but caspar walked...:)
 colombe 2d*: e15 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Next white move is "denots"-style
]
;W[hd]C[
 Tjl 5k*:  h16?

;B[de]C[
 colombe 2d*: e15 not good
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?

 jansteen 3d*:  e15 not good?
 Tjl 5k*:  e18?
 Tjl 5k*:  d18?
 Tjl 5k*:  c16?
 colombe 2d*: ok i play white now to try to prove that was not good :=)
 jansteen 3d*:  two moves agree: e18 and c16
 colombe 2d*: e18 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  e18 is the game
 jansteen 3d*:  c16 is interesting :)
 jansteen 3d*:  What's the idea of c16, malf?
 Tjl 5k*:  good or bad sense of c16?
 jansteen 3d*:  No, e18, c17 then h17, white much better
 colombe 2d*: if bl c17 then capture 3 stones
 imp NR : no hurry to e18, so first c16?
 jansteen 3d*:  What's idea of c16 imp?
 colombe 2d*: e18 is shape
 jansteen 3d*:  behind c16
 imp NR : not to force h17
 jansteen 3d*:  right, e18 is shape
 colombe 2d*: i think with e18 , white is ahead in all local fight here
 imp NR : and c16, e18, c17 or so ok for w?
 jansteen 3d*:  idea of c16 is that it makes miai of h17 and c15
 haihe 2k*:  how ahout h17?
 jansteen 3d*:  For example: c16, c15, h17
 colombe 2d*: if h17 , then e18 !
 jansteen 3d*:  Want to see?
 imp NR : yes:)

]
;W[jc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Difficult fight this
 colombe 2d*: c18
 colombe 2d*: complicated
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, very complicated
 imp NR : why not e19 instead of b16?
 jansteen 3d*:  Black will cut at d17?
 colombe 2d*: e19 ?
 colombe 2d*: white collapses
 colombe 2d*: what happen here ?
 jansteen 3d*:  agree imp?
 imp NR : ok, calc error:)
 jansteen 3d*:  White didn;t play c16, colombe
 colombe 2d*: yes e18 !
 jansteen 3d*:  This is tha game
 jansteen 3d*:  Seems severe, but black can cope
 jansteen 3d*:  This is critical variation to read when playing e15 btw
 jansteen 3d*:  Next? (2d+ pls be quiet)
 Tjl 5k*:  k17?
 Tjl 5k*:  or j15?
 imp NR : :)
 Tjl 5k*:  g14 improbable but somehow marginally possible?
 colombe 2d*: i am a fake 2d, can i give answer ?
 imp NR : study your tesuji, -2d:)
 colombe 2d*: hahha
 colombe 2d*: i would instintively and stupidly play at ...
 colombe 2d*: the same than happy
 jansteen 3d*:  k17 would loose the cutting stones
 jansteen 3d*:  j15 is bad style :)
 imp NR : not true:
 imp NR : k17, j18, h18 ok
 jansteen 3d*:  j18 is correct, well done!
 imp NR : but j18 much better of course:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Ah, k17, j18, h18!
 Tjl 5k*:  So why k17 wrong?
 Tjl 5k*:  From outside?
 jansteen 3d*:  But that's bad stule for black
 jansteen 3d*:  style
 Tjl 5k*:  ??
 imp NR : reason is: j18 works also
 jansteen 3d*:  I will show...

;B[ce]C[
 Tjl 5k*:  k18 not necessary, or is it?
 jansteen 3d*:  Black captures, but white gets j15 and f18
 imp NR : w get's no such squeeze if b plays j18
 colombe 2d*: lag !
 jansteen 3d*:  This is correct suji
 imp NR : that's important for d15 stoones: not to make white strong
 jansteen 3d*:  Black's stones work more efficiently this way
 jansteen 3d*:  Thanks imp
 Tjl 5k*:  but W l17 now -> black has no territory?
 jansteen 3d*:  l17 is the game :)
 jansteen 3d*:  l17 is poka
 imp NR : then m17: lose ladder
 Tjl 5k*:  k16
 Tjl 5k*:  leave cutting point at m16
 jansteen 3d*:  l17 was mistake by white
 imp NR : =blunder
 Tjl 5k*:  what should white have done?
 jansteen 3d*:  Tjl, k16 then j15 (atari)
 Tjl 5k*:  Ouuuuuch
 jansteen 3d*:  White shouldn't play l17/m17 exchange but leave it
 Tjl 5k*:  Yes. absolutely.
 imp NR : same as he does now (leave out l17-m17 exchange
 Tjl 5k*:  But there is still a lot of aji there if w doesn't play them
 jansteen 3d*:  Now everyone understands why this is suji (correct style)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 imp NR : knowing loose ladder tesuji is important: occurs many times in games
 Tjl 5k*:  e13
 jansteen 3d*:  e13 works?
 Tjl 5k*:  no, aim at sacrificing e15, d15 for wall ad c12 d12
