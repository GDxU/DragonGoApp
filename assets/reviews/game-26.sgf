 dsaun 7k*: who is better? white or black?
 dsaun 7k*: who is this white?
 jansteen 3d*: Hi dsaun, check the title!
 dsaun 7k*: i didn't see a title :(
 jansteen 3d*: Ok, here we go!
 jansteen 3d*: I just put it, sorry
 ardai 5d : otake B, kobayashi W];B[pd];W[cq];B[pq]C[
 ardai 5d : who wins this one, Jan? if w, then good for nomad toolearn \
a few things...];W[dc]C[
 ardai 5d : :)
 newbie 7k*: how to toggle off the title?
 ardai 5d : oops, otake is w?
 jansteen 3d*: Doesn't anybody mind if I give away the result? :-)
 tromp 4k*:  i mind
 newbie 7k*: I think Otake win
 Beethoven 8k*: i don't.
 ardai 5d : pls use tell to me, Jan, pretty pls?];B[qo]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Ok, how do we organise, I replay steady pace, and you st\
op me when you have questions, suggestions?
 ardai 5d : sure, anything u say
 tromp 4k*:  better move slow than fast
 jansteen 3d*: oops];W[kq]C[
 tromp 4k*:  so we can just appreciate the beauty of it:-)
 Beethoven 8k*: :)))
 ardai 5d : r5 is already unusual
 jansteen 3d*: r5 Koba-style :-(
 ardai 5d : not when d17, usually he does this if d17 is at d16
 tromp 4k*:  c15
 jansteen 3d*: The lower-edge reminds me of their Meijin game, two year\
s ago
 jansteen 3d*: Wow ardai! Such detail!
 jansteen 3d*: In that Meijin game d17 was indeed d16
 ardai 5d : i just read, while my little brother plays and plays :)
 jansteen 3d*: :-)
 tromp 4k*:  hard to imagine relationship between d16 and r5. is there \
a ladder in some variation?];B[cf];W[cd];B[ci]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Where next?
 ardai 5d : i think the idea is that d17 makes d15 urgent
 ardai 5d : c9?
 newbie 7k*: w in byomi now
 jansteen 3d*: How about c6 shape instead ardai?
 jansteen 3d*: Locally I mean?
 dslee 10k : is this Hideo not Koichi?
 ardai 5d : i think with l3, f4 is the local play
 jansteen 3d*: You're right I think
 tromp 4k*:  but f4 puts little pressure on c11
 jansteen 3d*: Any other ideas for next play?
 dslee 10k : first time for Hideo for meijin isn't it?
 ardai 5d : yes, that's why i said c9];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb]C[
 ardai 5d : tenuki
 jansteen 3d*: right!
 jansteen 3d*: Where?
 ardai 5d : f3];B[dp]C[
 ardai 5d : or n3
 ardai 5d : oops
 jansteen 3d*: Anyway right sense for direction ardai];W[dq]
C[
 tromp 4k*:  seems so natural once you see it];B[ep];W[bo]C[
 ardai 5d : d3 of course
 jansteen 3d*: Next?
 ddt 4d : but I don't like b here.
 tromp 4k*:  d7 too obvious?
 corolla 3k*: m17?
 tromp 4k*:  e3 perhaps
 ardai 5d : c6 then e7? i've seen him play like that];B[mq]
C[
 tromp 4k*:  must be around d7
 ardai 5d : d6 now?
 dsaun 7k*: uh, why n3?
 jansteen 3d*: black considers e4 enough bothersome, so takes big point\
?
 ddt 4d : n3 good.
 jansteen 3d*: e4 rather kikashi-like
 ardai 5d : yes
 dsaun 7k*: ok, thanks
 ddt 4d : I didn't like b because I didn't see n3.
 jansteen 3d*: Next move I can't understand really
 ddt 4d : if b plays around LL then l3 position is very good.
 jansteen 3d*: It seems "nurui", luckwarm...];W[pj]C[
 ardai 5d : hey! really!!
 tromp 4k*:  surprise indeed
 jansteen 3d*: yes, seems white dropped a stone, right?
 ardai 5d : yeah... strange move
 ardai 5d : but otake knows his stuff :)
 jansteen 3d*: I often critisize such moves from kyu players saying: "n\
ot severe, no follow-up!" :-(
 jansteen 3d*: yes, probably :-)
 ardai 5d : :)];B[qc];W[kc];B[iq];W[fr];B[io];W[qm]C[
 ddt 4d : if w has a plan about l3 q10 is ok.
 jansteen 3d*: Where next?
 newbie 7k*: g17
 ardai 5d : p7?
 Beethoven 8k*: r12
 tromp 4k*:  r9?
 jansteen 3d*: ardai is right about direction again :-)];B[on]
;W[qh];B[ol];W[pl];B[ok];W[pk]C[
 jansteen 3d*: where next?
 ardai 5d : seems o11 vital vor both
 newbie 7k*: r18
 Beethoven 8k*: d7?
 leica 25k : j8
 ardai 5d : o11
 jansteen 3d*: so far, leica is closest :-)
 jansteen 3d*: o11 looks good to me, but pro's are more modest than us \
:-)
 tromp 4k*:  j11
 ardai 5d : i see :)
 ardai 5d : k8 then?];B[jk]C[
 ardai 5d : i can't wait to see how otake pulls out L3
 tromp 4k*:  i thought only kyu players make such moves:-)]
;W[qb]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Who said r18 before?
 tromp 4k*:  would you critisize this from kyu player also, Jan?
 newbie 7k*: I said
 jansteen 3d*: Good sense then, newbie
 newbie 7k*: thanks:)
 jansteen 3d*: k9 shape is terrific, so hard to critisize :-)
 rest 2k*: who play this game?
 Hong 1d*: hi, everyone!
 ardai 5d : b tenuki one more time?
 jansteen 3d*: Now black moves strangely in my eyes: ....];B[rh]
;W[ri];B[nd]C[
 ardai 5d : wants to get sente];W[mc];B[rg]C[
 lee 8k*: how is R11?
 jansteen 3d*: strange combination of moves?
 lee 8k*: why?
 space NR : hi, Jan, who is kobayashi hideo?
 Hong 1d*: well, i know this game.
 ardai 5d : makes sense to me if he wants to settle this group, but i d\
on't see severe attach by w here
 dslee 10k : i think he's the young pro
 newbie 7k*: Otake won?
 Hong 1d*: kobayashi is the top go player of japan.
 jansteen 3d*: Thanks space, I corrected it :-)
 Hong 1d*: otake won by so much.
 jansteen 3d*: "Koichi"
 jansteen 3d*: Ok, where is next?
 dslee 10k : thanks jan
 newbie 7k*: kobayashi is easier for chinese players
 Clinton 2d : w has to think l3 or will lose
 ardai 5d : i have no clue :(
 ardai 5d : m9 seems too shallow
 jansteen 3d*: Hint: white starts *reducing* lower-right
 jansteen 3d*: ardai!
 Hong 1d*: if this game is what i know, w didnt care for L3 till the en\
d.];W[lk];B[ll]C[
 ardai 5d : wow, i would worry if i were w...];W[ml];B[lm];W[kk]
;B[jl]C[
 ddt 4d : I don't know if w q2 is still there.
 Hong 1d*: w won by pretty much. everyone thinks it so strange as you a\
rdai.
 jansteen 3d*: Tsuke-nobi in the center, quite often usual procedure...\

 jansteen 3d*: reducing continues now...];W[ro];B[qp];W[hr]
C[
 Hong 1d*: i heard Kobayashi, who is b, also thought it was so strange \
:)];B[ir]C[
 ardai 5d : wow!];W[hp]C[
 ardai 5d : i c];B[ip]C[
 jansteen 3d*: Ok, reducing stops here for the moment. Where next?
 ardai 5d : b can't cut here with h3
 Beethoven 8k*: w so confident.
 Hong 1d*: think that 9p doesnt know why he lost this game. ;)
 newbie 7k*: f16?
 ddt 4d : w has about 40 pts.
 space NR : b is too passive, I think
 jansteen 3d*: think bigger newbie!
 space NR : c9?
 jansteen 3d*: wrong direction space
 ardai 5d : c9 seems better?
 kerbrat 1d*: e14 ?
 ardai 5d : or g16?
 jansteen 3d*: g16 small thinking :-)
 jansteen 3d*: think big here
 space NR : m15?
 tromp 4k*:  e14
 ddt 4d : b is better now.
 ardai 5d : e14?
 space NR : :-))
 ardai 5d : i thinks so too, ddt

 jansteen 3d*: e14 is 90% answer I guess :-)

 ardai 5d : okay :)
 jansteen 3d*: ok, what's next?
 ardai 5d : m15 jumps out, but....
 jansteen 3d*: Think as if it's *your* game!
 Arkti 7k*: why artu's big brother just rnk as 5d :-)
 Clinton 2d : b o11 will be big
 ardai 5d : may not be severe enough
 jansteen 3d*: right ardai, think severely :-)
 ardai 5d : my little brother is a Go nut :)
 newbie 7k*: m14
 ardai 5d : does nothing but play, play, play..
 ardai 5d : i have to make a living, u know? :)

 jansteen 3d*: Amateur destiny :-)
 tromp 4k*:  k13 severe?
 kerbrat 1d*: L 14 ?
 ardai 5d : L14 possioble?
 jansteen 3d*: well thinking tromp, but what's vital point?
 space NR : l16?
 tromp 4k*:  k10!
 space NR : k14?
 jansteen 3d*: l14 is classic attack point

 jansteen 3d*: reason:
 ardai 5d : good move!];B[ke];W[me]C[
 ardai 5d : but i have no clue ofd the follow up)
 jansteen 3d*: In this position k14 occupies vital point
 jansteen 3d*: so....
 ardai 5d : now n15!
 jansteen 3d*: black is forced in bad shape
 jansteen 3d*: right!
 jansteen 3d*: nice attacking sequence, agree?

eless, so..."
 jansteen 3d*: Where is next?
 space NR : c13 now?
 ardai 5d : h17?
 ardai 5d : nah...
 jansteen 3d*: maybe last O-ba (big point) ?
