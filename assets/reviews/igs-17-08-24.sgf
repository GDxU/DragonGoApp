;B[od];W[rc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Guo Juan doesn't like s17 particularly since black can \
take sente now];B[me];W[rd];B[qf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  However black decides to play solidly (n15)
 jansteen 3d*:  Black could take sente playing n15 at o16, white o18]
;W[nq];B[lq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move?
 imp NR : o5?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, o5 most normal in such positions];W[qq]
C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Entering san-san is very brave];B[qp];W[pq]
;B[op];W[nr];B[mo]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move?
 imp NR : that's deep!
 jansteen 3d*:  o10 invades too deep, black will attack perfectly with \
m10
 imp NR : d10 possible here?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, d10 possible
 jansteen 3d*:  When thinking of correct move to reduce you do the\
following...
 jansteen 3d*:  You think about the black move which would turn the moy\
o into territory
 jansteen 3d*:  This often is your reducing move
 imp NR : around m8?
 jansteen 3d*:  So in this case probably l10
 imp NR : well, w wants to aim at cut at n4 also...];W[fc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  This white move aims at the cut at n16
 imp NR : maybe that invites b to cover weak point, too easy?
 imp NR : (money)
 jansteen 3d*:  imp, usually black will not fight after n4 but give in \
with m5
 jansteen 3d*:  imp says that k4 asks black to play l5, covering weakne\
ss
 imp NR : but w k4/ b l5 seems to aid black, no?
 jansteen 3d*:  And then k4 is too close to black's stones
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, k4/l5, black gains];B[cj];W[cl];B[cg]C[
 imp NR : jansteen: why n16-cut more interesting than n4-cut (so no f3,\
 but f17)];W[ce]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  I don't think there is much difference imp
 imp NR : my idea was that it is the opposite:)
 imp NR : o3/o4 more solid than o17?
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move starts a fight
 imp NR : c6:)
 jansteen 3d*:  I'm slightly suprised by black's next move
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, c6 :)];B[cn]C[
 imp NR : sakata is no moyo-builder
 jansteen 3d*:  If now white d6 black will play d5 since the ladder is \
good
 jansteen 3d*:  (why san-ren-sei then imp? :)
 jansteen 3d*:  What should white's strategy be in this fight?
 imp NR : to take territory, and fight at the same time:)
 jansteen 3d*:  You're too greedy imp :)
 imp NR : i'd say to attacsplitt and attack two groups?
 imp NR : no, not me, sakata is:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, if white can engage black in a running fight it \
would be perfect
 jansteen 3d*:  While running white can enter black's moyo in a natural\
 way
 jansteen 3d*:  So, next move?
 imp NR : so simply e8 or d9 not severe enough?
 jansteen 3d*:  e8 would leave black a nice move at b8, so d9 is indeed\
 most severe];W[dk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  replaying a game Basan];B[dj];W[fk]C[
 imp NR : ok, so b c3 now
 jansteen 3d*:  This movement is perfect for white (towards the black m\
oyo)
 jansteen 3d*:  No time for c3, e10 is too perfect];B[ej];W[dn]
C[
 jansteen 3d*:  And now>
 jansteen 3d*:  ?];B[cq];W[co];B[eq]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, local fight finished
 jansteen 3d*:  White to reduce black's moyo now
 imp NR : e3?
 imp NR : is that normal?
 imp NR : leaves very bad aji
 jansteen 3d*:  e3 leaves cut, agree
 imp NR : ai, what is enough now:)
 imp NR : n8 ok?
 jansteen 3d*:  White f9 helps white reducing
 jansteen 3d*:  Very good imp :)];W[mk]C[
 imp NR : so difficult this, my waekest point, such positions:(
 jansteen 3d*:  n9 better shape since white can later sabaki with p9 et\
 cetera...];B[ek];W[fm];B[cm];W[dm];B[bl];W[dq];B[dr];W[cr]
;B[er];W[bq];B[fo]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  f5 seems typical for Sakata's style];W[hp];B[gn]
;W[gq];B[fq];W[ko]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Now both players have a weak group];B[ho];W[ip]
;B[gr];W[hr];B[gp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black sabaki's his group (creates living shape)
 jansteen 3d*:  What will white do?
 imp NR : w not 100% alive in corner i think?
 jansteen 3d*:  Lower-left corner imp?
 imp NR : yes
 jansteen 3d*:  Seems alive since b5 and a5 are sente
 imp NR : o, nonsens:(
 imp NR : my idea i mean:)];W[mp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  As usual, pro's always have fair trades, black made liv\
ing shape, white cuts
 jansteen 3d*:  45th NHK: Sakata Eio (9p,B) vs Komatsu Hideki (9p,W)]
;B[lo];W[lp];B[kn];W[kp];B[no]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, white to play, where and what?
 jansteen 3d*:  Maybe first answer where?
 imp NR : help the lone w stone in some way;
 jansteen 3d*:  correct imp
 imp NR : l9?
 jansteen 3d*:  Correct again :)
 jansteen 3d*:  l9 is nice move since white can k6 next
 imp NR : p9 o verplay?];W[ok];B[pk]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  No, p9 is white's privilege (kikashi)];W[kk]
;B[jn];W[oj];B[ol];W[nh];B[oi];W[ni];B[oh]C[
 imp NR : well, i was afraid to say p9, because of b l9 answer:)]
;W[kh]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Then white q9 and the group will be very hard to kill
 jansteen 3d*:  Shall we count? both players played same amount of move\
s now
 imp NR : yes, probably:)
 jansteen 3d*:  White 49 + 5.5 + center group
 jansteen 3d*:  Black 48
 jansteen 3d*:  Both scores +- 3 points I guess :)
 imp NR : i would give about 5 more points to w; how do you count that?\

 jansteen 3d*:  So white indeed ahead
 jansteen 3d*:  You want a break down of the score imp?
 imp NR : if possible:)
 jansteen 3d*:  ok :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Lower right white s3 is white's privilege
 jansteen 3d*:  So endgame will be: s3 s4 t4 t5 t3 s5
 jansteen 3d*:  h3 endgame will be h3 j2
 jansteen 3d*:  So white 23 points in LR
 imp NR : I get: UR +- 10, LR +- 10; L-side +- 15, UL +- 15, LL +- 8
 jansteen 3d*:  I counted upper-left as 12 points since black c13 very \
thick
 jansteen 3d*:  ll endgame: black b5 white c4 black connect white c1
 jansteen 3d*:  So LL is 9 points
 jansteen 3d*:  UR = 12
 jansteen 3d*:  So how much in total?
 jansteen 3d*:  9 + 12 + 12 + 23 = 54
 jansteen 3d*:  I guess I forgot ll in previous count :)
 imp NR : + komi + middle
 jansteen 3d*:  middle is zero points imp, it's a weak group
 jansteen 3d*:  black left side: 14
 jansteen 3d*:  black bottom: 5
 imp NR : + 2 at least, otherwise b wins easily:)
 jansteen 3d*:  black right side: 35
 jansteen 3d*:  You cannot count like that imp :) It's more a handicap \
that group
 jansteen 3d*:  so black has 14 + 5 + 35 = 54
 imp NR : ok ok, jst kidding:)
 jansteen 3d*:  So white ahead by the komi anyway :)];B[bo]
;W[bp];B[bn];W[cs];B[cc];W[dc];B[be];W[bd]C[
 imp NR : well, both my feeling and these counts say: w a bit ahead:)]
;B[bf];W[bc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  If black is behind why not black try something in this \
corner?];B[re]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  s15 *very* big];W[mc];B[ld];W[rq];B[rp];W[sp]
;B[so];W[sq];B[rn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next largest endgame move?
 imp NR : h17
 jansteen 3d*:  Good imp];W[ic]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  j17 or h17 choice: hard to say :)
 imp NR : better, untime:)
 jansteen 3d*:  White already thick in UL so h17 probably ok]

C[
 jansteen 3d*:  That's it, counted?
 jansteen 3d*:  Nothing much happened since last count actually
 jansteen 3d*:  White more at the top, black's right side, center and l\
eft larger than expected
 imp NR : so should be w by _+ 5
 jansteen 3d*:  Any guesses? :)
 Io 20k*: white wins by 6.5?
 jansteen 3d*:  right, white +5.5
 jansteen 3d*:  Pity, Sakata out of the NHK cup
 jansteen 3d*:  ok, thanks for watching :)]
