 jansteen 3d*:  Thanks Girl :) Pls comment freely
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move played by inspiration, ideas? :)
 imp NR : hi malf:)
 imp NR : l3 or so normal
 jansteen 3d*:  Right, l3 is normal
 imp NR : but you suggest a real original move...
 jansteen 3d*:  White played untraditional move
 jansteen 3d*:  Right
 imp NR : o17 too normal then, q2 maybe? :)
 jansteen 3d*:  10 seconds...
 imp NR : q6?
]
;W[pn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Just in time!
 imp NR : :)

 jansteen 3d*:  What does white play next?
 imp NR : izumi white?
 c24 4k*:  o16?
 jansteen 3d*:  She just turned 22 this month
 jansteen 3d*:  Izumi is black
 imp NR : thx
 c24 4k*:  who is lzumi
 jansteen 3d*:  Yamashita will turn 21 later this year
 jansteen 3d*:  Izumi is Kobayashi Koichi's daugther
 imp NR : p5 seems to invite o3, that is bad?
 jansteen 3d*:  p3 and p6 correlate, that's correct
 jansteen 3d*:  white p3 aims either q2 or p5
 imp NR : n5 maybe? Or is q9 the direction?
 jansteen 3d*:  imp, white played these moves as kikashi, so he didn't play p5
]
;W[nc]C[
 imp NR : ah, tenuki
 jansteen 3d*:  Fuseki is a very visual stage of the game
 jansteen 3d*:  White o17 aims to flatten black completely towards the right edge of the board
 jansteen 3d*:  Correct direction sd, mover played was different though
 imp NR : i like sd's proposal
 imp NR : so m17?
 c24 4k*:  m17?
 jansteen 3d*:  Voyager, I don't know the tournament, but this is the semi-final game
]
;B[lc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move again inspired one
 c24 4k*:  r17?
 jansteen 3d*:  10 seconds for feeling to talk....
 DoctorGO NR : M16
 c24 4k*:  or m16?
]
;W[dj]C[
 DoctorGO NR : ;)
 jansteen 3d*:  This again proofs that you really can do a lot in fuseki
 imp NR : difficult game jan:)
 jansteen 3d*:  So when I see players play the same things in fuseki over and over again i always ...
 c24 4k*:  f3?
 jansteen 3d*:  suggest them to try things out, experiment
 DoctorGO NR : o16 simple
]
;B[fc]C[
 c24 4k*:  f3 also weak p6?
]
;W[ne]
;B[pf]
;W[kd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 c24 4k*:  m16 or l17?
 marine 3k*: m16

;B[md]C[
 c24 4k*:  w difficult?
]
;W[if]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Simple variation now would be: black j13, white h14, black o16, white m12, black k12, white m10
 imp NR : this uses p6/q6 stones for sicho?
 jansteen 3d*:  You mean if j15 now imp? :)
]
;B[kh]
;W[lh]C[
 imp NR : yes?
]
;B[lg]
;W[mg]
;B[kg]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  If black j15 then white captures with k13, right
 imp NR : oh, i see:) stupid

 jansteen 3d*:  Very cute variation :)
 imp NR : nice this:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Anybody knew this joseki? :)
 imp NR : seems ok for white
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move?
 DoctorGO NR : q 11?
 jansteen 3d*:  k16 is still there malf
 PAGER 1k*: q12?
 jansteen 3d*:  hi booboo :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi club
]
;W[ki]
;B[jd]
;W[ji]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, l11 very nice
 jansteen 3d*:  Anyone read my article on rec.games.go about tactics vs positional strength?
 jansteen 3d*:  l11 is a positional point which easily can win a game
 jansteen 3d*:  And loose a game when you miss it
 jansteen 3d*:  Next black move?
 imp NR : why l11, and not q12 or f16?
 jansteen 3d*:  semi-final of some tournament booboo, I don't know which (can not read it)
 imp NR : q12 first seems also ok?
 jansteen 3d*:  black is Izumi, 1p, white is Yamashita, 5p
 DoctorGO NR : H12?
 jansteen 3d*:  imp, q12 is interesting suggestion but if it does not capture white still has to l11 some time
 jansteen 3d*:  l11 is keypoint in the center

 imp NR : ah, so q12 was an aji keshi, there are alternative attacks there
]
;W[lj]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  righ imp, but only because white took l11 :)
]
;B[nk]
;W[ol]
;B[nl]C[
 DoctorGO NR : w l11 was really tough for b.
 jansteen 3d*:  The comments in the magazine say that black k16 was slow
 jansteen 3d*:  k16 should be j13, white f16, and black defend right side with q11
 imp NR : suggested alternative then for k16?
 jansteen 3d*:  semi-final of some tournament, maybe rising starts or similar
 jansteen 3d*:  starts = stars

 jansteen 3d*:  Sure :)
 DoctorGO NR : looking forward next time. :)
 imp NR : interesting game, thx jan:)
 jansteen 3d*:  But interesting points in this gam were white's fuseki and black's joseki
 jansteen 3d*:  Thanks :) till next time...
