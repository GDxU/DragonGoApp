 jansteen 3d*:  Hi
 imp NR : hi:) no title?
 jansteen 3d*:  Just set it, sorry
 jansteen 3d*:  28th Tokyo Cup, 2nd round, 1st game: Takemiya Masaki (9p,B) vs Yoda Norimoto (9p,W)
 imp NR : ok, away nad back:)
 imp NR : ok now
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, next mvoe?
 imp NR : :)
 imp NR : q16
 jansteen 3d*:  Good!
]
;B[pd]C[
 imp NR : (Takemiya, ok:)
 jansteen 3d*:  Takemiya black doesn't play anything else
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi shouzhuo!
 imp NR : hi shouzhuo, just in time:)
 jansteen 3d*:  You missed one question
 jansteen 3d*:  Right :)
 Pollux 11k :  hi
 jansteen 3d*:  No, I asked what was first move
 imp NR : (see title:) was for first move:)
 imp NR : hi malf, Pollux:)

;W[cp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  1995
 imp NR : hi everyone:)
 jansteen 3d*:  next?
 imp NR : q4 now
]
;B[pp]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi Frederic, long time no see!
 jansteen 3d*:  When I'm finished Aha :)
 jansteen 3d*:  really shouzhuo?

;W[dc]
;B[ep]
;W[eq]C[
 imp NR : just collect all jansteen-jansteen:)
 jansteen 3d*:  I resign many games recently
 jansteen 3d*:  Because e4 works too good with ni-rensei, shouzhuo?
 imp NR : well, indeed c4 might be better on e3
 jansteen 3d*:  I see, and agree :)

;B[fp]
;W[do]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Why d5 here?
 jansteen 3d*:  Or same question: what's next black?
 jansteen 3d*:  There is another reaqson
 jansteen 3d*:  Right shouzhuo
]
;B[jp]C[
 matane 6k*: k4
 jansteen 3d*:  If white d5 at c6 black can play q10, with d5 there white j4 or k4 would be too severe
 jansteen 3d*:  Clear malf?
 matane 6k*: r6?
 jansteen 3d*:  When white d5 on c6, shouzhuo?
 imp NR : jan means: after w c6 then q10 would be an option
 jansteen 3d*:  It's played shouzhuo
 jansteen 3d*:  Let me check....
 jansteen 3d*:  You're right shiuzhuo, my database has 15 games with d5 at c6
 jansteen 3d*:  11 continue with k4, 4 with k3
 jansteen 3d*:  Next move is typical Yoda style
 jansteen 3d*:  Any people who know Yoda?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right shouzhuo
]
;W[ce]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Yoda is very principle with shimari's: he makes them when he can :)
 brahms 5k*: Yoda in StarWars ?
 imp NR : so now q10 then
 jansteen 3d*:  Now: q10 or k16 direction?
 imp NR : if j17 around, then w gets both c16 and r6/q10, too good for w
 matane 6k*: takemiya like moyos then q 10..
 jansteen 3d*:  Very good reasoning imp
]
;B[pj]C[
 wrferrer 10k*:  q10 seems larger
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
]
;W[jd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Very simple fuseki this :)
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 imp NR : n16?
 jansteen 3d*:  Pls think about two alternatives here
 jansteen 3d*:  What's too slow, Jmm?
 wrferrer 10k*:  largest area seems to be the left side
 imp NR : c10 option, but i prefer UL
 imp NR : UR sorry
 jansteen 3d*:  Hi denots :)
 imp NR : hi denots:)
 jansteen 3d*:  I replayed our game yesterday on IGS
 wrferrer 10k*:  hi denots
 Minie 1k*: f7?
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, enough thinking?
 imp NR : q6 also option
 jansteen 3d*:  Only one person mentioned next move so far
 brahms 5k*: is k10 ok ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Two now :)
]
;B[pn]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Takemiya is happy with size of his moyo, he improves the quality with this move
 imp NR : this inserts some power in LR moyo
 jansteen 3d*:  malf: q6 is a shimari, as slow as c15 in a way
 jansteen 3d*:  Ah, that's why shouzhuo :)
 jansteen 3d*:  imp also got it
 brahms 5k*: on an invasion on R3 at wich side are you responding ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Next white is natural
 jansteen 3d*:  Thanks malf, just invented it :)
]
;W[nc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  But I think it's a good way to evaluate q6
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 imp NR : f7?
 jansteen 3d*:  p15 is very modern
 brahms 5k*: o16 ?
 wrferrer 10k*:  i have seen takemiya play p15
 jansteen 3d*:  He might have taken opponent into account while chosing next mover
]
;B[ne]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  malf got it (and more :)
]
;W[qc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes shouzhuo! You are Takemiya expert!
 brahms 5k*: R16
]
;B[pc]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  q17 is not what's in the books
 jansteen 3d*:  The book says: block at the wider side
 jansteen 3d*:  It feels unnatural with black's moyo lying below to block to the left
]
;W[qd]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  shouzhuo is right about r14 here: a modern invention by Takemiya I think
 jansteen 3d*:  But remember, this game was played in 1995
]
;B[pe]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 imp NR : ?
 imp NR : why no r15?
 jansteen 3d*:  imp is right, r15 also possible
 jansteen 3d*:  Actually, that's what commentator prefered
 imp NR : prefered what?
 jansteen 3d*:  r15
 jansteen 3d*:  agree shouzhuo
 jansteen 3d*:  Next?
 Minie 1k*: kibitz what is shouzhuo
 jansteen 3d*:  Yes, s14, why?
 jansteen 3d*:  Why, shouzhuo?
 jansteen 3d*:  If q18, black will r15 and strengthen his moyo
 imp NR : anyway, q18 then r15 too good for b
]
;W[rf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  s14 is the valuable side in this case
]
;B[qg]
;W[qf]
;B[pf]
;W[pb]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, black plays elsewhere now, ideas?
 imp NR : k14 only
 jansteen 3d*:  Good direction Egg!
 jansteen 3d*:  How about shape, f7 correct?
 imp NR : :(
 jansteen 3d*:  yes, malf!
]
;B[em]C[
 imp NR : ok, i wanted to f7 already earlier:)
 brahms 5k*: K10 ?
 wrferrer 10k*:  why is e7 better shape?
 jansteen 3d*:  right, e7 has affact on left side more than f7
 jansteen 3d*:  besides, f7 has annoying weakness at f6
 wrferrer 10k*:  thx
]
;W[cm]C[
 imp NR : hmm, c7 too slow seems, q3 does not solve any problem,
 jansteen 3d*:  Next (play elsewhere again)?
 imp NR : so around k10?
 jansteen 3d*:  Think of two alternatives again
 imp NR : (Too late and wrong:(
 jansteen 3d*:  Give two choices pls :)
 jansteen 3d*:  I consider k11 and j11 the same, shouzhuo, take two different ideas
 imp NR : k14 and e9
 jansteen 3d*:  Only expansion comes to mind here, right? k10 around?
 jansteen 3d*:  malf, locally p3 then
 imp NR : or p3
 jansteen 3d*:  s13 big, but not the moment yet
 jansteen 3d*:  Interesting choices you all give!
]
;B[ee]C[
 imp NR : d14 also poss
 wrferrer 10k*:  wow
]
;W[fd]
;B[ii]C[
 imp NR : i would understand d14, but not e15
 jansteen 3d*:  So all k11, j11, k10 guessers are right
 jansteen 3d*:  Right Egg, e15 feels a little bit like kikashi
 jansteen 3d*:  Although I think it's very close to aji-keshi as well
 brahms 5k*: now N4 ?
 jansteen 3d*:  Commentary doesn't say anything about e15
 jansteen 3d*:  So I guess it's just one of those moves which come from the stomach during the game
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, next one is also fun: white to invade, pls give three options :)
 brahms 5k*: N4, L11, Q8
 jansteen 3d*:  When I ever meet Takemiya I will ask him about e15, shouzhuo
 imp NR : m3 (1-th), q3 (2-th), j2 (to have an original one:) )
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, I restrict choice now: lower-right or center?
 imp NR : maybe center better....
 wrferrer 10k*:  i would invide lower right, then later center can be reduced
 brahms 5k*: first Center, then Corner
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, last hint: white entered center, pls choose a point
 jansteen 3d*:  Aha, better download the game later then
 brahms 5k*: k6 ?
 imp NR : :)
 jansteen 3d*:  One final hint: when invading create miai points for next move
 jansteen 3d*:  So you play invasion stone, make sure it has at least two follow-up moves/ideas
 imp NR : l8?
 jansteen 3d*:  This helps tremendously choosing invasion points
 brahms 5k*: k10 ??
 wrferrer 10k*:  g6
 jansteen 3d*:  You all choose points around the move actually played :)
]
;W[jl]C[
 imp NR : h10, then b k9 and w difficult, shouzuo
 jansteen 3d*:  You are kidding malf :)
 jansteen 3d*:  You think James Kerwin wouldn't invade this deep?
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, malf, I understand
 jansteen 3d*:  It might be that James stressed simplicity in his lessons, k8 is very difficult to handle properly
 jansteen 3d*:  Right shouzhuo
 jansteen 3d*:  k8 is sharp
 jansteen 3d*:  What to do with black now?
 jansteen 3d*:  I give two choices: h8 or l10
 imp NR : l10 seems to try and use the e15 stone, so I take that
 jansteen 3d*:  No Egg, I mentioned two ideas :)
 jansteen 3d*:  One is escaping, one is living inside
 jansteen 3d*:  Ok, all wrong :(
]
;B[hl]C[
 imp NR : this is the more natural of the two, no?
 wrferrer 10k*:  h 8 seems to use the e15 stone more than l10
 jansteen 3d*:  Now white shouldn't panic but again play a move which has two or more follow-up/ideas
]
;W[ll]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Good shouzhuo!
 jansteen 3d*:  This move works on eye shape and sets up l11
 imp NR : shouzhuo in great shape today:)
 jansteen 3d*:  If l11 gets blocked white can start sabaki manouvre with l5 for example
 jansteen 3d*:  So what will black play now: m5 or m10?
 jansteen 3d*:  Which peep malf?
 imp NR : no peep? Then m5
 imp NR : l7 peep
 jansteen 3d*:  l7 peep is generally bad, since it's an inside peep
 wrferrer 10k*:  m10 puts balck stones together
 jansteen 3d*:  l9 would be an attacking peep, with idea to start attack
]
;B[lo]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black converts moyo into territory at this point
 imp NR : but i though l10 the natural move here?
 jansteen 3d*:  Of course r3 still open, but that's of later concern
]
;W[ki]
;B[mi]C[
 imp NR : soory l11 natural for b (iso m5)?
 jansteen 3d*:  malf, you may only peep from outside, and only to make it heavy and attack :)
 jansteen 3d*:  White will anser malf
 jansteen 3d*:  l11 might be natural imp, it will be another game
 jansteen 3d*:  Right malf, that would also be another game
 jansteen 3d*:  Black didn't peep at l9 because n11 is a nice move
 jansteen 3d*:  What next for white?
 climate 1k*: is it a real-time game?
 imp NR : m11?
 jansteen 3d*:  Right imp, white has to take care of possible cutting
 climate 1k*: then why so slow?
 jansteen 3d*:  Actual move played is different

;B[gf]C[
 jansteen 3d*:  Black aiming all kind of things here
 jansteen 3d*:  A nice move
 jansteen 3d*:  Black aiming thinness of l13/k16 connection for example
 jansteen 3d*:  But also aiming invasion of top
 climate 1k*: aiming c14 and c8?
 jansteen 3d*:  And also creating some territorial potential on the left center

 climate 1k*: then  w r6, both risky

 imp NR : well, because that treathens t2 kill, as you just showed:)
 climate 1k*: what is  aji mean ( in chinese)?
 jansteen 3d*:  I mention this aji to make sure you will not die unexpectedly in your own game :)
 Io 26k : b r6 is sente because that leaves b s5, right?
 climate 1k*: hao wei dao
