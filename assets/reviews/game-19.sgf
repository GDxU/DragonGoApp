 nomad 5d*: it's "xiao song ying shu"
 zzzz 8k*: who are plying?
 jansteen 3d*: Thanks nomad!
 nomad 5d*: welcome :-)
 jansteen 3d*: This is: Fujitsu 1995/2: Komatsu Hideki (w,8p) vs. Yu Bin (b,9p)
 nomad 5d*: now that we got that FAQ out of the way....
 jansteen 3d*: The Fujitsu tournament is knockout in its final stages
 jansteen 3d*: This is the 2nd round of this final stage
 jansteen 3d*: The Fujitsu tournament is one of the most prestigeous international titles
 gameover 1d : who stay at this stage?
 jansteen 3d*: prestige is mainly determined by money involved and participants
 jansteen 3d*: A full report/scheme can be found on my WWW pages

 gameover 1d : o4 good?
 jansteen 3d*: Next move is obvious, so...?
 jansteen 3d*: Yes, o4 is fine
 angus 7k*: o17?
 DOLPHIN NR : hi, all
 tromp 3k*:  r10?
 jansteen 3d*: o17 is a normal choice
 nomad 5d*: r10 only
 jansteen 3d*: Right, r10 is the move
 tromp 3k*:  hi nomad:)
 nomad 5d*: hoi, tromp
 jansteen 3d*: nomad: your "only" ? :-)
 gameover 1d : rumor says nomad = LiLi
 jansteen 3d*: or really "only"?
 nomad 5d*: no, this is really only :-)
 jansteen 3d*: ok, thanks

;W[qj]C[
 nomad 5d*: LiLi is stronger than i am, gameover, i might as well clarify it once and for all
 jansteen 3d*: Now black has two ways to attack this stone, from the top or bottom
 jansteen 3d*: Which one in this case?
 kyyi 1k*:  R13
 gameover 1d : from bottom in this case
 tromp 3k*:  r12
 jansteen 3d*: right gameover
 nomad 5d*: r8 normal
 jansteen 3d*: The shimari is too weak to push the opponent against it

 angus 7k*: q12??
 jansteen 3d*: What would black have played when white would have s16 instead?
 gameover 1d : go to left?
 nomad 5d*: if w s16, b would r12
 jansteen 3d*: rigth nomad, preventing perfect shape
 DOLPHIN NR : some1 may choose p10 instead of q12
 nomad 5d*: if w tenuki, b would r15... latest on "joseki"
 jansteen 3d*: so what does black play now?
 kadenza 3d*: r15
 DOLPHIN NR : r15
 jansteen 3d*: really nomad? Not invade?
 angus 7k*: c10?
 nomad 5d*: p10 is ok if b o4 is at p3
 jansteen 3d*: right, r15
 jansteen 3d*: I see

 jansteen 3d*: Next move is also interesting? Where?
 DOLPHIN NR : s14?

 jansteen 3d*: Good Dolphin, s14 more valuable than q14
 nomad 5d*: s15, then d10?

 jansteen 3d*: Interesting idea nomad, would that be another option here?
 nomad 5d*: i think so
 DOLPHIN NR : f3?

 jansteen 3d*: Right again Dolphin :-)

;B[fq]C[
 DOLPHIN NR : ha, I am 9p ur to now:)
 jansteen 3d*: agree nomad, c10 is also very usual/normal
 gameover 1d : seems r15 can't protect the corner much
 DOLPHIN NR : up to now
 angus 7k*: i am so weak to think c10-d10 is big :(
]
;W[cn]C[
 nomad 5d*: well, now w can d10
 DOLPHIN NR : k3?
 jansteen 3d*: angus, f3 is two-folded: expansion and reduction
 jansteen 3d*: c10 is invasion without risk + splitting move
 jansteen 3d*: Both are extremely valuable moves
 gameover 1d : angus is doing fine :)
 angus 7k*: yes, i c f3 is very big jansteen
]
;B[jc]C[
 angus 7k*: with r8, i would feel comfortable with a stone at f3
 jansteen 3d*: This move seems slow but is quite important, right nomad?
 DOLPHIN NR : k17 is hard to guess
 nomad 5d*: sure, jan
 gameover 1d : ' we even can't expect too much for a 1d :)
 huayao 6k*: can r 17 or p17 for w?
 jansteen 3d*: k17 is important to protect white from playing the (very annoying) move at m17
 gameover 1d : yeah, hate m17
 jansteen 3d*: agree huayao, r17 raised in value now
 DOLPHIN NR : e3 then k3?

;W[qc]C[
 gameover 1d : w needs attack now?
 jansteen 3d*: How do you think nomad, still normal or "early" ?
 nomad 5d*: hmm, seems early to me, i would have played j3....
 nomad 5d*: shows you how little i know
 kadenza 3d*: corner is small
 kadenza 3d*: since w has s14
 DOLPHIN NR : is it a bit early? r17
 jansteen 3d*: not true nomad!
