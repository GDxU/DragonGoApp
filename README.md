Version 2 of DragonGoApp
========================

Main differences with version 1:

- Much cleaner code and improved robustness by removing un-necessary and unstable features: OGS support, sgf reviews, dev-DGS support
- Works without SD-card: v2 exploits the internal memory application cache, which prevent issues on lollipop or without SD-card. It is more secure also. Also makes uninstalling the app cleaner.
- No more use of Fragments
