DragonGoApp
===========

Android app to play the game of go with the Dragon Go Server.

This is a new experimental android app to use for DGS, with the following features:

* Open-source: everyone knows exactly what's it doing, and you're welcome to fork and update it to your needs !
* Ad-free
* Minimize bandwidth usage: this is especially useful when you have a limited quota of 3G data connection;
* Full-featured SGF editor/player based on the open-source eidogo code. Also shows game information and game comments.
* Support dual servers/credentials (DGS and develDGS)
* Playing moves (obviously !), pass, resign, send/receive messages, attach a public comment to a move
* invite/accept/refuse challenges, challenge in 19x19 ladder
* Follow reviews of professional games from gobase, which are included in the app

Limitations:

* Ending game (territory agreement, scoring) is supported by displaying the DGS website, for now.
* When inviting or accepting a game, you cannot change the game settings (handicap...) for now
