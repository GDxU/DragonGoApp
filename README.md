DragonGoApp
===========

Android app to play the game of go with the Dragon Go Server.

This is a new experimental android app to use for DGS, with the following features:

* Open-source: everyone can know exactly what it's doing and all of the app's internals.
* Ad-free
* Minimize bandwidth usage: this is especially useful when you have a limited quota of 3G data connection;
* Full-featured SGF editor/player based on the open-source eidogo code. Also shows game information and game comments.
* Support dual servers/credentials (DGS and develDGS)
* Playing moves (obviously !), pass, resign, send/receive messages, attach a comment to a move
* invite/accept/refuse challenges, challenge in 19x19 and 9x9 ladders
* Follow reviews of professional games from gobase, which are included in the app
* Read the DGS Forums: by default, only the new/unread messages will be shown, but you can switch to read all messages by pressing menu-settings while in the forums view.

Limitations:

* Ending game (territory agreement, scoring) is supported by displaying the DGS website, for now.
* When inviting or accepting a game, you cannot change the game settings (handicap...) for now
