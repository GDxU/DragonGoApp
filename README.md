DragonGoApp
===========

Android app to play the game of go with the Dragon Go Server.

This is a new experimental android app to use for DGS, with the following features:

* Open-source: everyone knows exactly what's it doing, and you're welcome to fork and update it to your needs !
* Ad-free
* Minimize bandwidth usage: this is especially useful when you have a limited quota of 3G data connection;
* Full-featured SGF editor/player based on the open-source eidogo code. Also shows game information and game comments.
* Support dual servers/credentials (DGS and develDGS)
* Playing moves (obviously !), send/receive messages, invite/accept/refuse challenges

Note that ending game (territory agreement, scoring) is supported by displaying the DGS website, for now.
