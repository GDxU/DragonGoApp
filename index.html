<p>Android app to play the game of go on the DGS and OGS servers.</p>

<hr>

<h2>
<a id="nutshell" class="anchor" href="#nutshell" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
DragonGoApp in a nutshell
</h2>

There are two ways to play the game of Go (aka Baduk) online: either live (a game lasts about half an hour) or
by correspondence (a game may last several weeks). DragonGoApp is a mobile Android application for playing
correspondent games with both main online servers that support correspondence games:
<a href="http://www.dragongoserver.net/">Dragon Go Server</a>
and
<a href="https://online-go.com">Online-go.com</a>

<br>

<p>
Playing by correspondence is very nice for busy people, because you can play just one move whenever you have 5 minutes free time, anytime.
Also, in most cases you play several games simultaneously (up to a dozen for me), which always let you with some goban to handle
whenever you wish to. If you like go, I strongly encourage you to try correspondence games on any of the two servers above !
</p>

<p>
Because you typically play correspondence games on the go (at lunch time, in the bus...), mobile applications are ideal tools to
get you entertained all day long.
DragonGoApp is one such application for your android smartphone.
It is also the only android app I know of that seamlessly supports both DGS and OGS servers, and is free and opensource (which means
that there is absolutely no annoying ad, tracking, limited features, paying premium...).
Furtermore, it is completely safe (the source code is public and the apk is certified by F-Droid) and it minimizes bandwidth usage,
hence saving your mobile data plan.
</p>

<h3>Important limitation</h3>
<p>
As explained before, DragonGoApp is designed to continue playing the same games everyday during several weeks,
because it is the most important feature for playing correspondence games on the go.
But it does not (or badly) support neither initializing a new game, nor terminating a game, because both these operations
occur only very rarely in correspondence games, and may involve complex server-dependent interactions with the server.
</p>
<p>
So, before using DragonGoApp to play, first start/initialize one or a few games on a real computer that is connected to either DGS or OGS.
You can of course also play moves on your computer or anywhere, and the next time you run DragonGoApp, it will automatically
update the games on your mobile.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, when you reach the end of a game and want to pass, quit the app and pass and finalize your game on a real computer as well.
</p>

<h3>Overview of how to play with DragonGoApp</h3>

<ul>
<li>Once the apk is installed, setup your DGS and/or OGS login and password in DragonGoApp
<li>Whenever you have some time to play a move, just launch DragonGoApp and press "GetGames"
<li>Your games are then downloaded from DGS and/or OGS and shown on the goban one after the other
<li>You can then explore variations on the goban, and when you're decided, place your stone and send your move to the server.
Alternatively, you can skip the current game and show the next one.
</ul>


<h3>
<a id="quick-ogs-startup" class="anchor" href="#quick-ogs-startup" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quick OGS-startup</h3>

<ul>
<li>OGS uses OAuth2 for authentication: before doing anything with the android app, you must first go, with a real computer browser, on your online-go.com profile and generate an application-specific password.</li>
<li>If you want to play on OGS, you have to download and install the android app 
with the "download apk" button at the top of this page
(Note that, because of OGS security restrictions, both the versions distributed from GitHub and F-droid will not be able to connect to OGS !)</li>
<li>Launch the app for the first time, and wait for about two minutes for the app to configure its local storage on your phone.</li>
<li>Then, click on the settings menu of your phone, and choose the "Settings" sub-menu:
a window appears with a field for the user name and another field to enter the password.
Writes in these fields your OGS login and the application-specific password that you have generated before.
Then, press the "OGS" button to let the app know that these credentials shall be used with the OGS server.</li>
<li>You then want to select to which servers DragonGoApp shall try to connect, using the DGS and OGS check-boxes on the
"advanced" options:
Press the button "..." on the top right of the main window to reach the advanced options, scroll down until you see
the OGS and DGS checkboxes.
If you just want to play with OGS, you must check the "OGS" checkbox and uncheck the "DGS" checkbox;
otherwise, the app will stop at connection time because it can not connect to DGS, and you won't even see your OGS games.</li>
<li>You can then return to the main screen, and just press the top-left "Games" button: the app will download the games
where it's your turn to play, and show you the first game. You can try various moves: use the "Reset" button to come back
to the initial position where you have to move. When you're ready, press "Reset", play one move, and press the "Send" button.
A confirmation window will pop-up. Press OK, the move is sent, and the app will automatically switch to the next game,
or just shows a message saying that you don't any more games to play.</li>
<li>Later on, when you want to play again, just press the "Games" button to try and download your last opponents moves.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="how-to-start-playing" class="anchor" href="#how-to-start-playing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quick-start DGS</h2>

<p>Before playing, you must enter your DGS login and password via the "menu/settings" dialog. The app supports two user logins for DGS, and when you
use the "menu/settings" to enter credentials, these credentials are stored for the currently selected user. By default, it's the first
user. Changing to the second user can be done by selecting the "devLogin" in the list of commands trigerred by the fifth rightmost button.
You can also select here the "devDGS" (development DGS) server, but you probably shouldn't care about it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Press <em>Games</em> to download the games where it's your turn to play</li>
<li>Click on the board where you wanna play</li>
<li>Press <em>Sent</em> . the next game to move will be shown automatically.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the app is pretty good for playing games, but not very good for counting game score (when you arrive at this stage, the app
just shows the DGS page of the game) or finding an opponent. 
Although you can challenge opponents from within the app in 19x19 and 9x9 DGS ladders, 
I recommend to do it from the web site.</p>

<hr>

<p>Both games from DGS and OGS are handled and stored the same way internally: only the "get-games" and "send-moves"
connections are specific to each server.
</p>

<p>Note that there is much more features in DragonGoApp, but this is just a quickstart guide and you're welcome to try all
other features at your pace...</p>

<h3>
<a id="main-user-guide" class="anchor" href="#main-user-guide" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Main user guide</h3>

<p>This is an android app originally developed for DGS (and now also OGS), with the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open-source: everyone can know exactly what it's doing and all of the app's internals.</li>
<li>Ad-free</li>
<li>Small bandwidth usage: this is especially useful when you have a limited data plan; The app shows you <em>in real time</em> your data usage (globally at the mobile level, not only for the app itself);</li>
<li>Full-featured SGF editor/player based on the open-source eidogo code. Also shows game information and game comments.</li>
<li>Support dual servers/credentials (DGS and develDGS)</li>
<li>Playing moves (obviously !), pass, resign, send/receive messages, attach a comment to a move</li>
<li>invite/accept/refuse challenges, challenge in 19x19 and 9x9 ladders</li>
<li>Follow reviews of professional games from gobase, which are included in the app</li>
<li>Read the DGS Forums: by default, only the new/unread messages will be shown, but you can switch to read all messages by pressing menu-settings while in the forums view.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can install the latest release from <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=dragongoapp&amp;fdid=fr.xtof54.dragonGoApp">F-droid</a>
Note that the F-droid apk can only play with the DGS server, because of security constraints on OGS.
So if you want to play on OGS, prefer the "download apk" button at the top of this page.

<h1>
<a id="quick-start" class="anchor" href="#quick-start" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Description</h1>

<p>When run for the first time, a "loading" window appears for a few seconds: it's actually not downloading anything at this stage,
but it's just uncompressing the eidogo javascript library onto the SD-card. This is only done once.</p>

<h2>
<a id="gui-overview" class="anchor" href="#gui-overview" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>GUI overview</h2>

<p>The 5 top-left buttons always present the most useful function at any time:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Games</em> : download status games from DGS server</li>
<li>
<em>Zm+</em> : Zoom-in the goban</li>
<li>
<em>Zm-</em> : Zoom-out the goban</li>
<li>
<em>Msg</em> : download status messages from DGS server</li>
<li>
<em>Fwd</em> / <em>Bck</em> : navigate in the game; these buttons are redundant with the arrows on the goban.</li>
<li>
<em>Reset</em> : comes back to the original position (as in the server): very useful when exploring lines of play, just before sending the actual next move you wanna play.</li>
<li>
<em>Send</em> : send your last move to DGS. A confirmation dialog is shown.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a top-right button <em>...</em> that shows a list of additional functionalities:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Skip this game</em> : when you don't want to answer right now</li>
<li>
<em>Resign game</em> : pretty clear</li>
<li>
<em>Add a game message</em> : press this before sending a move, and a comment will be attached to this move in the SGF. Two standard comments are proposed (to welcome and thank you opponent), but you can write your own. You can also edit or remove your comment as many times as you wish as long as you have not sent the move.</li>
<li>
<em>View 19x19 ladder</em> : shows only the ladder positions that you can challenge. Uses a local cache, so it may not be always synchronized with the actual ladder in DGS, but you can re-download the ladder at any time.</li>
<li>
<em>View 9x9 ladder</em> : same thing for another ladder</li>
<li>
<em>View forums</em> : download the list of forum messages that you have not read yet (or all of them)</li>
<li>
<em>List saved games</em> : every game is saved locally, so you can view it, and even play a move from this list. You can also remove all or a single game from your sd card.</li>
<li>
<em>DGS/login</em> : these 4 buttons allow to select another user or another server</li>
<li>
<em>reset GUI</em> : press it to come back to the initial GUI, as if you just had launched the app</li>
<li>
<em>Open game reviews</em> : continues the reading of Pro games reviews</li>
<li>
<em>recopy Eidogo</em> : for debugging only</li>
<li>
<em>redraw last goban</em> : shortcut to quickly view the last goban</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that although the "look and feel" of DragonGoApp is not very appealing,
this app actually has all the required functionalities (and even more) to really do its job, i.e., playing correspondence Go with DGS and OGS !
</p>

<h2>
<a id="bandwidth-efficiency" class="anchor" href="#bandwidth-efficiency" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bandwidth efficiency</h2>

<p>Very few buttons actually connects to the Internet: <em>Games</em>, <em>Send</em>, <em>View forums</em> and the first time you press one of the <em>View ladders</em> button, or when you later on press <em>Reload</em> when viewing a ladder.</p>

<p>In fact, the app is designed to
only access the Internet when it's really useful, hence minimizing bandwidth and consumption of your data plan. This has always been
a major design guideline when writing this app, and you can actually always check in real time, on the top-right of the status bar, the
total amount of internet connection that has been consumed by the app since it's been launched. Typically, you can play one move in 6 or 7 games with less than a few dozens of kbits of bandwidth.</p>

<p>Starting from version 1.8, the app caches locally the game SGF and the ladders (<em>not the forums</em>).
But by default, it'll reload the SGF at every move.
You can switch to a more bandwidth-saving mode via the menu: "Bandwidth config, prefer local SGF".
Then, when downloading the status list of games, it also gets the last move of your opponent, which is simply added to the local SGF.
The SGF will not be downloaded any more.
This greatly reduces bandwidth consumption and improves playing speed, BUT this approach has one drawback: you don't see the comments
sent by your opponent and attached to each move, because the "get status" connection does not return these comments ! 
If you want to see them, then you should switch back via the bandwidth menu to the "always download SGF" option.
Then, you will also always get all comments attached to every move.</p>
